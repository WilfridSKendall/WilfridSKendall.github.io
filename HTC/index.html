<h1>HTC: Languages at Pentecost 28th May 2023</h1>


<p>
Here are various translations of "the wonders of the Lord God are extraordinary".
For each language the translation is written out in the alphabet of the language
and then again using the English alphabet to help you sound it out. In 
several cases there is also a link to an audiofile of someone speaking the sentence
in the language!
