<h1>Wilfrid Kendall's Personal Page</h1>

<p>
I am an emeritus professor in the Statistics department at the University of Warwick. 
My research interests lie mostly in probability theory, and include: 
random processes, stochastic geometry, stochastic calculus, computer algebra in statistics and probability, and perfect simulation. 
I was President of the <a href="http://www.bernoullisociety.org/">Bernoulli Society</a> over the period 2013-2015; 
I served on the Council of the <a href="http://isi-web.org/">International Statistical Institute</a> over 2015-2019. 
I was founding co-director of <a href="http://www.apts.ac.uk/">APTS</a> (first with my colleague <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/">David Firth</a>, 
then with my colleague <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen/">Adam Johansen</a>) 
over the period October 2007 - September 2016. 
A few years ago I found myself back on the APTS Executive Committee for a brief period: <em>deja vu</em> all over again.</p>

<p>
Here's a <strong><a href="http://www.bernoullisociety.org/files/BernoulliNews2019-2.pdf#page=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memento</a></strong>
of a very happy occasion at the end of 2019, 
kindly organized by <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/stephen-connor/">Stephen Connor</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/thonnes/personal">Elke Thonnes</a>.

I occasionally add short entries to my blog <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/randomcuriosities/">Random Curiosities</a>
about thoughts that crop up when teaching or researching.

<h2>Recent research projects</h2>
<p>I have recently concluded EPSRC-funded research projects on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/nilpotent/">Probabilistic coupling and nilpotent diffusions;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/insideout/">Inside-out: Statistical methods for Computed Tomography validation:</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R022100/1">Dirichlet forms and Markov chain Monte Carlo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With my then-research student <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gzanellawebpage/home">Dr Giacomo Zanella</a>, 
I worked on a project to apply statistical methods to contribute to debates in Anglo-Saxon history:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/settlements/">Anglo-Saxon Placenames and Point Processes</a>.</li>
</ul>
