**Abstract:**
Dating back as far as the classic Metropolis et al.  (1953) paper, approximate samples  have been drawn by engineers, mathematicians, physicists and statisticians from probability densities with unknown normalizing constants, by considering long-time runs of Markov chains designed to have the desired probability density as equilibrium. In all but the most trivial instances, a major question is: how long should one run the Markov chain in order for it to be approximately in equilibrium? Propp and Wilson (1996) made a major breakthrough by showing that (in favourable cases) one can achieve an exact draw from equilibrium by (a) running the chain for a random not a deterministic length of time, and (b) running it from the far past till now rather than from now till the far future, and (c) using ingenious coupling. This idea is variously called Coupling from the Past (CFTP), Exact Simulation or Perfect Simulation; wide-ranging reviews can be found in Kendall (2005) and Huber (2015). In this talk I will review CFTP and some of its developments. I shall describe how CFTP works in a simple case, discuss the very visual example of “dead leaves” from stochastic geometry, review the work of Connor and myself (2015) on perfect simulation for multiserver queues, and describe some work in progress by Connor and myself on the application of perfect simulation to some inference problems for the S-I-R epidemic.
