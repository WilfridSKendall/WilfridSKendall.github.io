abstract = {We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to approximately simulate a centered d-dimensional Gaussian vector X with given covariance matrix. The standard Monte Carlo method is based on the Cholesky decomposition, which takes cubic time and has quadratic storage cost in d. By contrast, the additional storage cost of our algorithm is linear in d. We give a bound on the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the distribution of our sample and the target distribution. Our method can be used to estimate the expectation of h(X), where h is a real-valued function of d variables. Under certain conditions, we show that the mean square error of our method is inversely proportional to its running time. We also prove that, under suitable conditions, the total time needed by our method to obtain a given standardized mean square error is quadratic or nearly quadratic in d. A numerical example is given.},

We prove that, for reversible chains at least, variance bounding is weaker than, but closely related to, geometric ergodicity. Furthermore, variance bounding is equivalent to the existence of usual central limit theorems for all L2 functionals. Also, variance bounding (unlike geometric ergodicity) is preserved under the Peskun order. We close with some applications to Metropolis–Hastings algorithms.},

@article{BusicGaujalPin-2011,
abstract = {Perfect sampling is a technique that uses coupling arguments to provide a sample from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain in a finite time without ever computing the distribution. This technique is very efficient if all the events in the system have monotonicity property. However, in the general (non-monotone) case, this technique needs to consider the whole state space, which limits its application only to chains with a state space of small cardinality. Here, we propose a new approach for the general case that only needs to consider two trajectories. Instead of the original chain, we use two bounding processes (envelopes) and we show that, whenever they meet, one obtains a sample under the stationary distribution of the original chain. We show that this new approach is particularly effective when the state space can be partitioned into pieces where envelopes can be easily computed. We further show that most Markovian queueing networks have this property and we propose efficient algorithms for some of them.{\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a probabilistic approach for the study of systems with exclusions in the regime traditionally studied via cluster-expansion methods. In this paper we focus on its application for the gases of Peierls contours found in the study of the Ising model at low temperatures, but most of the results are general. We realize the equilibrium measure as the invari- ant measure of a loss network process whose existence is ensured by a subcriticality condition of a dominant branching process. In this regime the approach yields, besides existence and uniqueness of the measure, properties such as exponential space convergence and mixing, and a central limit theorem. The loss network converges exponentially fast to the equilibrium measure, without metastable traps. This convergence is faster at low temperatures, where it leads to the proof of an asymptotic Poisson distribution of contours. Our results on the mixing properties of the measure are comparable to those obtained with “duplicated-variables expansion,” used to treat systems with disorder and coupled map lattices. It works in a larger region of validity than usual cluster-expansion formalisms, and it is not tied to the analyticity of the pressure. In fact, it does not lead to any kind of expansion for the latter, and the properties of the equilibrium measure are obtained without resorting to combinatorial or complexanalysis techniques.},

abstract = {We provide a general methodology for unbiased estimation for intractable stochastic models. We consider situations where the target distribution can be written as an appropriate limit of distributions, and where conventional approaches require truncation of such a representation leading to a systematic bias. For example, the target distribution might be representable as the {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}-limit of a basis expansion in a suitable Hilbert space; or alternatively the distribution of interest might be representable as the weak limit of a sequence of random variables, as in MCMC. Our main motivation comes from infinite-dimensional models which can be parame- terised in terms of a series expansion of basis functions (such as that given by a Karhunen-Loeve expansion). We consider schemes for direct unbiased estimation along such an expansion, as well as those based on MCMC schemes which, due to their dimensionality, cannot be directly imple- mented, but which can be effectively estimated unbiasedly. For all our methods we give theory to justify the numerical stability for robust Monte Carlo implementation, and in some cases we illustrate using simulations. Interestingly the computational efficiency of our methods is usually comparable to simpler methods which are biased. Crucial to the effectiveness of our proposed methodology is the construction of appropriate couplings, many of which resonate strongly with the Monte Carlo constructions used in the coupling from the past algorithm and its variants.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for estimating likelihood ratios for stochastic compartment models when only times of removals from a population are observed. The technique operates by embedding the models in a composite model parameterised by an integer k which identifies a switching time when dynamics change from one model to the other. Likelihood ratios can then be estimated from the posterior density of k using Markov chain methods. The techniques are illustrated by a simulation study involving an immigration-death model and validated using analytic results derived for this case. They are also applied to compare the fit of stochastic epidemic models to historical data on a smallpox epidemic. In addition to estimating likelihood ratios, the method can be used for direct estimation of likelihoods by selecting one of the models in the comparison to have a known likelihood for the observations. Some general properties of the likelihoods typically arising in this scenario, and their implications for inference, are illustrated and discussed.},

abstract = {We present a perfect simulation algorithm for measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to some Poisson process and can be obtained as invariant measures of birth-and-death processes. Examples include area- and perimeter-interacting point processes (with stochastic grains), invariant measures of loss networks, and the Ising contour and random cluster models. The algorithm does not involve couplings of the process with different initial conditions and it is not tied up to monotonicity requirements. Furthermore, it directly provides perfect samples of finite windows of the infinite-volume measure, subjected to time and space "user-impatience bias". The algorithm is based on a two-step procedure: (i) a perfect-simulation scheme for a (finite and random) relevant portion of a (space-time) marked Poisson processes (free birth-and-death process, free loss networks), and (ii) a "cleaning" algorithm that trims out this process according to the interaction rules of the target process. The first step involves the perfect generation of "ancestors" of a given object, that is of predecessors that may have an influence on the birthrate under the target process. The second step, and hence the whole procedure, is feasible if these "ancestors" form a finite set with probability one. We present a sufficiency criteria for this condition, based on the absence of infinite clusters for an associated (backwards) oriented percolation model. The criteria is expressed in terms of the subcriticality of a majorizing multitype branching process, whose corresponding parameter yields bounds for errors due to space-time "user-impatience bias". The approach has previously been used, as an alternative to cluster expansion techniques, to extract properties of the invariant measures involved. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

We present a theoretical analysis of the rate of convergence of many of the widely used Markov chains. For N characters generated from a uniform mixture of two trees, we prove that the Markov chains take an exponentially long (in N) number of iterations to converge to the posterior distribution. Nevertheless, the likelihood plots for sample runs of the Markov chains deceivingly suggest that the chains converge rapidly to a unique tree. Our results rely on novel mathematical understanding of the log-likelihood function on the space of phylogenetic trees. The practical implications of our work are that Bayesian MCMC methods can be misleading when the data are generated from a mixture of trees. Thus, in cases of data containing potentially conflicting phylogenetic signals, phylogenetic reconstruction should be performed separately on each signal.},

The single-server queue is useful in applications of Dominated Coupling from the Past (DCFTP), which is awell-known protocol for simulation without bias from steady-state distributions. Our algorithm terminates in finite time, assuming only finite mean of the interarrival and service times. To simulate the single-server queue in stationarity until the first idle period in finite expected termination time, we require the existence of finite variance. This requirement is also necessary for such idle time (which is a natural coalescence time in DCFTP applications) to have finite mean. Thus, in this sense, our algorithm is applicable under minimal assumptions.},

abstract = {This paper develops the first class of algorithms that enables unbiased estimation of steady-state expectations for multidimensional reflected Brownian motion. In order to explain our ideas we first consider the case of compound Poisson input. In this case, we analyze the complexity of our procedure as the dimension of the network increases and show that under certain assumptions the algorithm has polynomial expected termination time as the dimension increases. Our methodology includes procedures that are of interest beyond steady-state simulation and reflected processes. For instance, we use wavelets to construct a piece-wise linear function that can be guaranteed to be within {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} distance (deterministic) in the uniform norm to Brownian motion in any compact time interval.},

Our method involves the general method of dominated coupling from the past (DCFTP) and we use the single-server M/G/1 queue operating under the processor sharing discipline as an upper bound. Our algorithm yields the stationary distribution of the entire Kiefer–Wolfowitz workload process, the first coordinate of which is D . Extensions of the method to handle simulating generalized Jackson networks in stationarity are also remarked upon.},

abstract = {I describe a simple procedure for investigating the convergence properties of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. The procedure employs multiple runs from a sampler, using the same random deviates for each run. When the sample paths from all sequences converge, it is argued that approximate equilibrium conditions hold. The procedure also provides a simple diagnostic for detecting modes in multimodal posteriors. Several examples of the procedure are provided. In Ising models, the relation between the correlation parameter and the convergence rate of rudimentary Gibbs samplers is investigated. In another example, the effects of multiple modes on the convergence of coupled paths are explored using mixtures of bivariate normal distributions. The technique is also used to evaluate the convergence properties of a Gibbs sampling scheme applied to a model for rat growth rates (Gelfand et al 1990).},

abstract = {On any locally-finite geometry, the stochastic Ising model is known to be contractive when the inverse-temperature $\beta$ is small enough, via classical results of Dobrushin and of Holley in the 1970s. By a general principle proposed by Peres, the dynamics is then expected to exhibit cutoff. However, so far cutoff for the Ising model has been confirmed mainly for lattices, heavily relying on amenability and log Sobolev inequalities. Without these, cutoff was unknown at any fixed $\beta$ {\textgreater} 0, no matter how small, even in basic examples such as the Ising model on a binary tree or a random regular graph. We use the new framework of information percolation to show that, in any geometry, there is cutoff for the Ising model at high enough temperatures. Precisely, on any sequence of graphs with maximum degree d, the Ising model has cutoff provided that $\beta$ {\textless} $\kappa$/d for some absolute constant $\kappa$ (a result which, up to the value of $\kappa$, is best possible). Moreover, the cutoff location is established as the time at which the sum of squared magnetizations drops to 1, and the cutoff window is O(1), just as when $\beta$ = 0. Finally, the mixing time from almost every initial state is not more than a factor of 1 + ∈$\beta$ faster then the worst one (with ∈$\beta$ →0 as $\beta$ →0), whereas the uniform starting state is at least 2 -∈$\beta$ times faster.},

abstract = {We present the first class of perfect sampling (also known as exact simulation) algorithms for the steady-state distribution of non-Markovian loss networks. We use a variation of Dominated Coupling From The Past for which we simulate a stationary infinite server queue backwards in time and analyze the running time in heavy traffic. In particular, we are able to simulate stationary renewal marked point processes in unbounded regions. We use the infinite server queue as an upper bound process to simulate loss systems. The running time analysis of our perfect sampling algorithm for loss systems is performed in the Quality-Driven (QD) and the Quality-and-Efficiency-Driven regimes. In both cases, we show that our algorithm achieves sub-exponential complexity as both the number of servers and the arrival rate increase. Moreover, in the QD regime, our algorithm achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence.},

For three models the optimality of assigning customers to the server with smallest workload, FCFS, is shown. In the first two models isolated queues are studied, their difference being that in the first the cost functions are related to the workload, while in the second the departure processes are compared. The third model is concerned with networks of multi-server queues.},

We prove a necessary and suﬃcient condition on the two intensities for the existence of a coupling of $\Pi$ and $\Gamma$ such that $\Gamma$ is a deterministic function of $\Pi$, and all points of $\Gamma$ are points of $\Pi$. The condition exhibits a surprising lack of monotonicity. However, in the limit of large intensities, the coupling exists if and only if the expected number of points is at least one greater in $\Pi$ than in $\Gamma$.},

abstract = {A stochastic discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model for infectious diseases is developed with the aim of estimating parameters from daily incidence and mortality time series for an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995. The incidence time series exhibit many low integers as well as zero counts requiring an intrinsically stochastic modeling approach. In order to capture the stochastic nature of the transitions between the compartmental populations in such a model we specify appropriate conditional binomial distributions. In addition, a relatively simple temporally varying transmission rate function is introduced that allows for the effect of control interventions. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference that are used to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over state variables of the model, which are unobserved. This provides a realistic stochastic model that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of the disease and the effect of control interventions.},

abstract = {The M/G/K queueing system is one of the oldest models for multiserver systems and has been the topic of performance papers for almost half a century. However, even now, only coarse approximations exist for its mean waiting time. All the closed-form (nonnumerical) approximations in the literature are based on (at most) the first two moments of the job size distribution. In this paper we prove that no approximation based on only the first two moments can be accurate for all job size distributions, and we provide a lower bound on the inapproximability ratio, which we refer to as "the gap." This is the first such result in the literature to address "the gap." The proof technique behind this result is novel as well and combines mean value analysis, sample path techniques, scheduling, regenerative arguments, and asymptotic estimates. Finally, our work provides insight into the effect of higher moments of the job size distribution on the mean waiting time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {The well-known reflection coupling gives a maximal coupling of two one-dimensional Brownian motions with different starting points. Nevertheless, the reflection coupling does not generalize to more than two Brownian motions. In this paper, we construct a coupling of all Brownian motions with all possible starting points (i.e., a grand coupling), such that the coupling for any pair of the coupled processes is close to being maximal, that is, the distribution of the coupling time of the pair approaches that of the maximal coupling as the time tends to {\$}0{\$} or {\$}\backslashinfty{\$}, and the coupling time of the pair is always within a multiplicative factor {\$}2e{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} from the maximal one. We also show that a grand coupling that is pairwise exactly maximal does not exist.},

Their use is illustrated for the particular case where only susceptible, infective, and removed states are represented using simulated realizations of the process. By comparing estimated likelihoods with theoretical forms, in cases where these can be derived, or with the known model parameters, we show that the methods can be used to provide meaningful estimates of parameters and parameter uncertainty.

abstract = {Simulation plays an important role in stochastic geometry and related fields, because all but the simplest random set models tend to be intractable to analysis. Many simulation algorithms deliver (approximate) samples of such random set models, for example by simulating the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain such as a spatial birth-and-death process. The samples usually fail to be exact because the algorithm simulates the Markov chain for a long but finite time, and thus convergence to equilibrium is only approximate. The seminal work by Propp and Wilson made an important contribution to simulation by proposing a coupling method, coupling from the past (CFTP), which delivers perfect, that is to say exact, simulations of Markov chains. In this paper we introduce this new idea of perfect simulation and illustrate it using two common models in stochastic geometry: the dead leaves model and a Boolean model conditioned to cover a finite set of points.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a perfect simulation algorithm for the stable M/G/c queue. Sigman (2011) showed how to build a dominated coupling-from-the-past algorithm for perfect simulation of the super-stable M/G/c queue operating under first-come- first-served discipline. Sigman's method used a dominating process provided by the corresponding M/G/1 queue (using Wolff's sample path monotonicity, which applies when service durations are coupled in order of initiation of service). The method exploited the fact that the workload process for the M/G/1 queue remains the same under different queueing disciplines, in particular under the processor sharing discipline, for which a dynamic reversibility property holds. We generalise Sigman's construction to the stable case by comparing the M/G/c queue to a copy run under random assignment. This allows us to produce a na{\"{i}}ve perfect simulation algorithm based on running the dominating process back to the time it first empties. We also construct a more efficient algorithm that uses sandwiching by lower and upper processes constructed as coupled M/G/c queues started respectively from the empty state and the state of the M/G/c queue under random assignment. A careful analysis shows that appropriate ordering relationships can still be maintained, so long as service durations continue to be coupled in order of initiation of service. We summarise statistical checks of simulation output, and demonstrate that the mean run-time is finite so long as the second moment of the service duration distribution is finite.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
The article describes two algorithms for perfect simulation of a stable M/G/c queue. It generalizes Sigman's method, which dominates an M/G/c queue with the corresponding M/G/1 queue, while coupling their service times in order of initiation of service. ("Domination'' here refers to inequalities that compare queues or queueing disciplines according to queue lengths, workloads, etc.) Sigman's coupling is useful, however, only when the M/G/1 queue is stable, or equivalently, only when a very restrictive hypothesis of super-stability for the M/G/c queue is in force. The present article generalizes Sigman's construction from super-stable to stable M/G/c queues by comparing an M/G/c queue to a copy under the random assignment discipline. The copy is then equivalent to c independent copies of an M/G/1 queue. The workload process for the M/G/c queue remains invariant under various queueing disciplines, in particular under the judicious choice of a processor-sharing discipline, which endows the copy with dynamic reversibility. A naive algorithm then runs the copy backward in time until the copy first regenerates by emptying. The algorithm then samples the (equilibrium) queueing state at time 0 ("coupling from the past''). Because of frequent practical interest in simulating queues with heavy traffic, the naive algorithm can be expensive, however. A second, more efficient coupling algorithm therefore sandwiches the M/G/c queue between lower and upper bounding queues. It then simulates backward in time until it can sample the equilibrium queueing state at time 0 unambiguously. An empirical assessment of the algorithms and a discussion of future directions for research conclude the article. Reviewed by John Lawrence Spouge},

abstract = {This is a case study concerning the rate at which probabilistic coupling occurs for nilpotent diffusions. We focus on the simplest case of Kolmogorov diffusion (Brownian motion together with its time integral or, more generally, together with a finite number of iterated time integrals). We show that in this case there can be no Markovian maximal coupling. Indeed, there can be no efficient Markovian coupling strategy (efficient for all pairs of distinct starting values), where the notion of efficiency extends the terminology of Burdzy and Kendall (2000). Finally, at least in the classical case of a single time integral, it is not possible to choose a Markovian coupling that is optimal in the sense of simultaneously minimizing the probability of failing to couple by time t for all positive t . In recompense for all these negative results, we exhibit a simple efficient non-Markovian coupling strategy.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
Let B be a standard real-valued Brownian motion. A standard generalized Kolmogorov diffusion of index k is a vector-valued process I˜=(I˜0,I˜1,{\ldots},I˜k), defined recursively as 
I˜0(t)=B(t),I˜r(t)=∫t0I˜r−1(s)ds,r=1,2,{\ldots},k.
This paper studies probabilistic coupling in the class of Kolmogorov diffusions. In particular, it addresses the issues of maximal coupling, Markovian coupling, and efficient coupling as well as the coupling rate. 
   If T=inf{\{}t{\textgreater}0:Xs=X˜s for all s≥t{\}} is a coupling time of two coupled process X and X˜, then a coupling is called maximal if it simultaneously minimizes P(T{\textgreater}t) for all t{\textgreater}0. The paper starts with deriving the rate of maximal coupling: 
P(T{\textgreater}t)∼O(1tk+1/2).

   Generally, explicit constructions of maximal couplings are hard, in which case Markovian couplings may be a way to proceed. (Markovian couplings are the couplings that produce a joint process with marginals being transition probability kernels of the coupled diffusions.) The authors prove that, regrettably, in the case of Kolmogorov diffusion there can be no maximal Markovian coupling. 
   Next, the notion of efficient coupling is introduced, in the spirit and extending that of K. Burdzy and W. S. Kendall [Ann. Appl. Probab. 10 (2000), no. 2, 362–409; MR1768241]. It is then shown that no efficient Markovian coupling exists for the Kolmogorov diffusions. 
   In the last part, as a compensation for previous "negative'' discoveries, the authors construct a nice non-Markovian coupling strategy, called finite-look-ahead coupling, which does achieve efficiency. Reviewed by Gennady Shaikhet},

@article{Lindley-1952,
abstract = {The study of queues has been of interest to mathematicians and engineers for the past forty years, and a very extensive literature on the subject exists. The applications of the theory are many and varied, from Erlang's original work on telephone engineering, to present-day studies in the design of airports. The number of papers which deal with the theoretical side of the subject is, however, small, and it therefore seems desirable to attempt to develop a general theory which will cover the diverse practical requirements, so that the unity in the applications will become apparent. This paper gives such a development in the case where there is a single queue and a single server attending to it; the theory of multiple queues or many servers seems, except under simplifying assumptions which do not always correspond to reality, to be a problem of considerable difficulty. Previous work on the subject has mainly been confined to a special case where the customers arrive at random, as, for example, in a recent paper by Kendall(5);* the present theory makes no such assumption and allows the customers to join the queue in other ways, though the theory simplifies when the more restrictive assumption is made. The centre of interest in the present theory is the waiting times of the customers.},

abstract = {Common cluster models for multi-type point processes model the aggregation of points of the same type. In complete contrast, in the study of Anglo-Saxon settlements it is hypothesized that administrative clusters involving complementary names tend to appear. We investigate the evidence for such a hypothesis by developing a Bayesian Random Partition Model based on clusters formed by points of different types (complementary clustering). As a result, we obtain an intractable posterior distribution on the space of matchings contained in a k-partite hypergraph. We apply the Metropolis- Hastings (MH) algorithm to sample from this posterior. We consider the problem of choosing an efficient MH proposal distribution and we obtain consistent mixing improvements compared to the choices found in the literature. Simulated Tempering techniques can be used to overcome multimodality and a multiple proposal scheme is developed to allow for parallel programming. Finally, we discuss results arising from the careful use of convergence diagnostic techniques. This allows us to study a data set including locations and place-names of 1316 Anglo-Saxon settlements dated approximately around 750-850 AD. Without strong prior knowledge, the model allows for explicit estimation of the number of clusters, the average intra-cluster dispersion and the level of interaction among place-names. The results support the hypothesis of organization of settlements into administrative clusters based on complementary names.},

The dead leaves model, introduced by the Mathematical Morphology school, consists in the superposition of random closed sets, and enables to model the occlusion phenomena. When combined with specific sizes distributions for objects, they are known to provide adequate models for natural images. However this framework yields a small scales cutoff and a limit random field is introduced by letting this cutoff tend to zero. We first give a rigorous definition of the dead leaves model, and compute the probability that n compacts are included in distinct visible parts, which characterizes the model. Then, we derive our limit model and some of its property, and study its regularity.},

ACM TOMACS, 25, 26) for exactly simulating the maximum of a negative drift random walk queue endowed with independent and identically distributed (iid) increments, we extend it to a multi-dimensional setting and then we give a new algorithm for simulating exactly the stationary distribution of a first-in-first-out (FIFO) multi-server queue in which the arrival process is a general renewal process and the service times are iid; the FIFO GI/GI/c queue with 2 $\backslash$le c {\textless} 1. Our method utilizes dominated coupling from the past (DCFP) as well as the Random Assignment (RA) discipline, and complements the earlier work in which Poisson arrivals were assumed, such as the recent work of Connor and Kendall (2015: Perfect simulation of M/G/c queues. Advances in Applied Probability, 47, 4). We also consider the models in continuous-time and show that with mild further assumptions, the exact simulation of those stationary distributions can also be achieved. We also give, using our FIFO algorithm, a new exact simulation algorithm for the stationary distribution of the infinite server case, the GI/GI/$\backslash$infty model. Finally, we even show how to handle Fork-Join queues, in which each arriving customer brings c jobs, one for each server.},
