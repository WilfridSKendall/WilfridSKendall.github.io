Sketch of MCMC (II)   {#sec-MCMC-II}
===================
\note{We begin with a visual introduction to some simple ideas from Markov chain thery
which are fundamental to MCMC and perfect simulation.
\par}
* \structure{Markov chain basics}:
	- \structure{Transition probabilities} \(p(a,b)\) 
	(or \structure{transition rates} in continuous time: 
	unified view using exponential distribution);
	- Εquilibrium probabilities \(\pi(a)\), balance,  
	\qquad \structure{detailed balance} \(\pi(a) p(a,b)=\pi(b) p(b,a)\), 
	\structure{reversibility};
	- Aperiodicity, recurrence (and uniform and geometric recurrence);
	- under detailed balance we can \structure{condition} by forbidding transitions;  
	
* We can modify any chain, transition probabilities \(p(a,b)\),
to leave a specified target distribution \(\pi(a)\)
\structure{invariant}, by \structure{censoring} each possible transition 
\(a\to b\) with probability \(\alpha(a,b)\in[0,1]\)
such that  
\qquad
\(\alert{\alpha(a,b)}\pi(a) p(a,b)=\alert{\alpha(b,a)}\pi(b) p(b,a)\);
* Common choice: \structure{Metropolis-Hastings}  
\qquad\(\alpha(a,b) = \min\{1,(\pi(b) p(b,a)) / (\pi(a) p(a,b))\}\).
* If result still irreducible aperiodic, then \(\pi(a)\)
is its long-term equilibrium.
* This is MCMC, now of intense interest to statisticians. 
* But, physicists always remind us, physicists got there fifty years earlier!

Sketch of MCMC (III)   {#sec-MCMC-III}
====================
Given the \(\pi(a)\), how to \structure{design}
a Markov chain to have this as equilibrium?

(i) \structure{Independence sampler}: draw from a fixed probability distribution,
apply Metropolis-Hastings;
(ii) \structure{Random walk Metropolis} or \structure{RWM}: propose move using a random walk,
apply Metropolis-Hastings;
(iii) \structure{Metropolis-adjusted Langevin} or \structure{MALA}:
make a Gaussian jump shifted using gradient of \(\log\pi\), apply Metropolis-Hastings.\pause

Can mix-and-match! RWM is often favourite: flexible, not too complicated.\pause

Issues:

(A) \structure{Burn-in}: _How long_ till approximate equilibrium?
(B) \structure{Scaling}: _How big_ should be the RWM jump?\pause

Question (B) is about how to get fast mixing. There is a beautiful and useful theory, but
that is for another day.\pause

Question (A) is what this lecture is all about.

Sketch of MCMC (IV)   {#sec-MCMC-IV}
===================
* MCMC practicalities: Burn-in: what to do about it?
	- Theory tends to be much too pessimistic. Example: Zanella [-@Zanella-2014; -@Zanella-2015b] developed statistical methods for Anglo-Saxon history: a  _simplified_ model appeared to converge approximately in \(10^5\) steps (about 1 week on compute cluster), _versus_ \(10^9\) steps in theory (around 2 centuries);
	- Is (a) one long run better or (b) many short runs? (Option (b) requires starts of short runs spread "evenly" over the sample space — almost as hard in high dimensions as the original problem!)
	- Diagnostics? (Meta-theorem: for any diagnostic technique there is a chain for which the technique is deceptive!)
	- Conclusion: effective MCMC requires very careful thought about appropriate length of run — think deeply about the problem! 
* Can there ever be a better way?

Perfect Simulation  {#sec-perfection}
==================
\note{
Jim Propp described the discovery of CFTP as like walking down the street and suddenly noticing
a 50\$ bill lying on the ground.
\par}
* The idea of exact simulation / Coupling from the Past (CFTP) / perfect simulation @ProppWilson-1996a  (Persi Diaconis: “Like seeing the landscape of Mars for the first time”);
* Ideas (of “_classic CFTP_”): 
	- extending simulation _backwards_ through time, 
	- exploit monotonicity by coupling maximal and minimal processes, 
	- seek coalescence;
* Details for _random-walk-CFTP_, which can be boosted as above to provide simple image reconstruction of an image using Ising model, @ProppWilson-1996a show how to vary a clever algorithm to get exact samples for 
\structure{critical} Ising model (this is what impressed Diaconis);
* “Perfect simulation” [@Kendall-1998d]: because everyone knows it isn’t going to be perfect, whereas people might imagine “exact simulation” would somehow miraculously defeat numerical approximation error :-).


An example and some theory  {#sec-example}
==========================
\note{To be very clear, the special "dead leaves" example of CFTP
was probably well-known to the French workers in 
statistics of geology who invented the "dead leaves" model, well before CFTP had been formally invented.
\par}
* An intensely visual example, which helps many people see intuitively what is going on here, is _DeadLeaves-CFTP_ [@KendallThoennes-1999] (technically, _Occluded CFTP_);
* What about cases where monotonicity fails? or there isn’t a sensible “maximal” process? @Kendall-1998d: 
	* cross-couple upper and lower envelope processes, 
	* dominate by amenable “dominating process” (time-reversible, can draw from equilibrium, can couple target processes below dominating process); 
* Theoretical limits:  _in principle_
	- _Classical CFTP_ equivalent to uniform ergodicity [@FossTweedie-1998]. 
	- _Dominated CFTP_ is achievable under geometric ergodicity [@Kendall-2004c]. 
	- It is even possible to carry out Dominated CFTP in some **non**-geometrically ergodicity cases [@ConnorKendall-2007a; _nb_ corrigendum];
* We can use _Dominated CFTP_ to carry out perfect simulation for stable point processes [@KendallMoeller-2000];
* Detailed expositions are given by @Kendall-2005a, @Huber-2015. @Kendall-2014b shows
how to implement CFTP in R.

Applications to Queues and Epidemics  {#sec-applications}
====================================
\note{The figure refers to a recent crisis 
in which \textbf{both} queues \textbf{and} epidemics played a major part!
\par}
![An illustration introducing _both_ queues _and_ epidemics!](https://covidposters.github.io/images/queues.png){width=3.5in}

Perfect Queues  {#sec-queues}
==============
 The simplest queuing model (Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, single server) can be analyzed very thoroughly;

* Poisson arrivals are not unreasonable, but exponential service times are ludicrous. The \(M/G/1\) case of general service time _for just one server_ can use the “embedded chain” (sample at instants of departure);
\note[item]{Why are Exponential service times ludicrous? They imply that the fact that
you have been waiting one hour for the previous customer to complete service 
\textbf{has no bearing} on how much longer you still have to wait.
On second thoughts this can be an accurate model in some dire cases! Fortunately,
analysis of the \(M/G/1\) case can use the celebrated Pollaczek-Khintchine formula.}
* Multi-server case: computation of eg waiting-time distribution is out of reach so use simulation [and insights from @KieferWolfowitz-1955];
\note[item]{Kiefer \& Wolfowitz (1955) is a remarkable paper, establishing a fundamental stochastic recursion
for the \emph{KieferWolfowitz workload vector}.}
*  @Sigman-2011 shows how to do CFTP in the "super-stable" case (traffic so low that it could have been handled by just one server), using Dominated CFTP and comparing to a "Processor-sharing" discipline.
\note[item]{Sigman's result is ingenious and pioneering, but is limited mainly to the case when there is not much
need for an \(M/G/1\) queue with \(c>1\).}

---

* @ConnorKendall-2014 show how to extend @Sigman-2011, showing how Dominated CFTP can be applied to simulate (sub-critical!) queues perfectly (and this has now been generalized by others to the case of non-Poissonian inter-arrival times). (Technical point: pathwise domination requires service times to be assigned in order of commencement of service!)  
    - dominate \(M/G/c FCFS\) (FCFS means first come first served)  
    by \(M/G/c RA = [M/G/1 RA]^c\)  
    (RA means assign to individual servers on arrival);
\note[item]{FCFS becomes FIFO ("first in first out") for a single server.}
\note[item]{\(M/G/c RA = [M/G/1 RA]^c\) is clearly less efficient than \(M/G/c FCFS\); this works pathwise 
so long as we assign service times in order of commencement of service.}
    - use fact that _workload_ of \(M/G/1 FCFS\) is same as \(M/G/1 PS\)
    which can be run backwards in time in equilibrium;  
     (PS means arrivals Share Processor.)
\note[item]{Calculations for time reversal apply the ideas underlying the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula.}
    - so \([M/G/1 PS]^c\) can be used to provide Dominated CFTP.
* @ConnorKendall-2014 also compare  
    (a) CFTP coupling when dominating process empties, 
    (b) a faster CFTP coupling using upper and lower processes 
    starting respectively at dominating process and at empty state. 
\note[item]{Using upper and lower "sandwiching" is introduced as part of Dominated CFTP in WSK (1998).}

Results (II)
------------
\note{
Algorithm choice really does make a difference.
In this case, using upper and lower processes results in run-times shorter by a factor of 32,
more than compensating for some increased complexity.

Results (III)
-------------
\note{
Here, for fun, a detailed look at the six most heavily loaded servers in equilibrium
for an \(M/G/c=25\) queue. 

Notice how server 25 is definitely carrying a heavier load!
Perfect simulation allows us to have an easy confidence in these simulation results.

Perfect Epidemics  {#sec-epidemics}
=================
* Even the simple case of deterministic S-I-R permits only *partial* closed-form solution;
* Suppose **only** the “removal times” are observed? Can the infection times be simulated perfectly? (Given basic parameters.)
* **YES**: work in progress by Connor and Kendall. Here is a GIF illustrating this for a real-life small-pox epidemic;
* (be clear about assumptions!)
* (indicate how the perfect simulation algorithm can be used as a high-dimensional integration device to enable simulation-based Bayesian inference!). 

Conclusion  {#sec-conclusion}
==========
* You don’t always have to put up with burn-in issues when doing MCMC;
* CFTP works even for significantly complex and relevant models of real-life phenomena;
* _Of course_ really detailed models are still going to resist perfect simulation: but it will always be helpful to compare with a simpler model (using fewer parameters!). 
* CFTP is clearly an important tool to be considered by the investigator seeking to do accurate and informative MCMC.
