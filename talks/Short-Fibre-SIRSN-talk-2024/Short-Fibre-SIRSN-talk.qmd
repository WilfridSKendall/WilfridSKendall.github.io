Development of work on line process models for transportation networks  
[@AldousKendall-2007; @Kendall-2011b; @Kendall-2014a],  
particularly concerning line process models for online maps:  
[@Aldous-2012; @AldousGanesan-2013;  @Kahn-2015; @Kendall-2014c; @Kendall-2019].

. . .

\structure{Objective of this work:} model online maps,
but replace infinitely long straight lines by line segments ("sticks")
or moderately curved paths ("stiff fibres").

\note{Very much work-in-progress!
\par}

. . .

Structure of talk:

1. Modelling efficient spatial transport systems (illustrating and setting up axiomatic approach to SIRSN);
2. Practicalities (why the two current SIRSN models are unsatisfactory);
3. Sticks and fibres (brief notes on some key results and proofs).

(I) Models for efficient spatial transport systems 
==================================================
How to model real-life online maps? a task for \structure{stochastic geometry}.

. . .

1. Mechanism to connect generic nodes \(x\) and \(y\);  
\note[item]{Online mapping using Google, or Bing, or OpenStreetMap,
is a mechanism constructing routes from source-destination pairs.}

2. "Scale -invariant" networks (\structure{SIRSN}) as potential models; 
\note[item]{Aldous (2014) axioms for suitable random mechanisms.  
Are there any examples?  
Are there "many" examples?}

3. What do "best routes" look like? 
\note[item]{Given the axioms, and a mechanism, we'd also like to know some qualitative information
about routes produced by the mechanism.}

4. \textcolor{gray}{What can be said about flows? -- not for today.} 
\note[item]{Too ambitious for now, but if traffic is being produced uniformly
(say between all possible source-destination pairs) what can we say about 
distribution of traffic load over the network?}

. . .

\structure{Related to} work on mathematics for cities, for example:  

 - Work on city shape [@BenderBenderDemaineFekete-2004; @Courtat-2012];  
 - Route-finding [@BongiornoZhouKryvenTheurelRizzoSantiTenebaumRattii-2021];  
 - "Transit nodes" [@BastFunkeSandersSchultes-2007].  

\note[item]{Related work on: what mathematical cities might look like,
how to get from A to B, fast route-finding using "portals".}

. . .

\structure{Work so far:} models based on _eg_ Poisson line processes (\alert{Plp}) 
[@AldousKendall-2007; @Kendall-2011b; @Kendall-2014c; @Kahn-2015; @Kendall-2019; @Blanc-2022].
\note[item]{So far work has centred on idealized line-based examples. We'd prefer
models using line segments or even fibres (\(\CtsDiff\) curves).}

. . .

\structure{We'd strongly prefer:} models based on \emph{\alert{localizable}} object processes  
(_eg_ Poisson stick processes, Poisson fibre processes).
\note[item]{"Localizable": is it possible for these models
to be flexible enough
to admit useful statistical modelling?}

Online maps look as if they might be scale-invariant!
=====================================================
![Road connections between six European cities including Köln  
\hfill (data from \texttt{GraphHopper} and \texttt{OpenStreetMap}).](image/SIRSN-illustration.png){ height=250px }
\note{Here is a network of connections between some cities in
the west of Germany and Holland.

Varying translucence indicates route re-use.

\par}

\note[item]{Some visual indication of scale-invariance / self-similarity.
Coupled with this, scale-invariance is a good device for 
focussing attention on a model without having to worry about arbitrary "edge effects" at small or large scale!}

\note[item]{Routes re-use roads.
Consider the portions of routes connecting a given set of nodes
more than a specified distance away
from route source and terminus.
It seems not unreasonable to stipulate
that the length density of the union of \emph{all} such portions
could actually be bounded above,
regardless of the total number of nodes.}

\note[item]{The underlying challenge: capture the essence of
a good online map axiomatically!  \\
\textcolor{red}{Here is a visual introduction to the basic axiomatic framework.}}

An online map as a mechanism for generating networks
====================================================
![SIRSN as mechanism generating unique _routes_ \(\Route(x,y)\) from \(x\) to \(y\).](image/SIRSN-def.png){ height=200px }
\note{The illustration depicts the route between Köln and Bonn.
\par}

\note[item]{Think of the online map mechanism as a random map from finite sets of nodes
to networks connecting up these nodes, behaving consistently with respect to subsets of nodes
and introduction of new nodes.
In particular the online map mechanism
is determined by the routing function
(a symmetric function from pairs of nodes to connecting route).
Here is a particular route.}

\note[item]{It is important to emphasize that the routing function is symmetric: 
we require \(\Route(x,y)=\Route(y,x)\).
Additionally, if \(z\) lies between \(x\) and \(y\) on \(\Route(x,y)\) then
\(\Route(x,z)\) should be the appropriate sub-path of \(\Route(x,y)\)!}
\note[item]{\emph{Uniqueness} of route is intrinsically necessary 
(and interacts with proofs of other properties); 
checking this in actual models can require non-trivial work!}

Given \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\), the online map should generate a _network_
\[
\Network(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\quad=\quad 
\bigcup\left\{\Route(x_i,x_j)\;;\; 1\leq i < j \leq n\right\}\,.
\]

\scriptsize
**NB:** we disallow one-way streets: \(\Route(x_i,x_j)=\Route(x_j,x_i)\).

Axiom 1: (Statistical) scale-invariance of networks
===================================================
![SIRSN networks must be scale-equivariant.](image/SIRSN-def.png){ height=200px }
![](image/SIRSN-scale.png){ height=200px }
\note{Here we compare routes between between Köln and Bonn (left)
and (the longer route) Köln and Dusseldorf (right).
(Please shut your eyes to the existence of the Rhine here!)
\par}

We require _statistical scale invariance_: for all similarities \(\Similarity\) of \(\Reals^m\):
\[
\Law{\Similarity\Network(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}\quad=\quad 
\Law{\Network(\Similarity x_1, \ldots, \Similarity x_n)}\,.
\]
\note[item]{Scale-invariance: equivariance under rotation, translation, \emph{and} scaling.
The statistical details of the route should depend neither on orientation nor location:
and we avoid the need to think about boundary effects of scale by imposing the empirically satisfying notion
of scale-invariance. Compare notion of \emph{statistical shape}.}
\note[item]{The illustration indicates scale-invariance just for single routes, but it needs to hold for all networks connecting multiple source/terminus locations \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\).}
\note[item]{Scale-invariance is related -- by the need for a hierarchy related to scales -- to the existence of a scale-index \(\Index\): more on this later.}
\note[item]{In order to be able to formulate the notion of scale-invariance at all, the mechanism
\alert{must} have some randomness.}

\scriptsize
**NB:** we model \(\Route(x_i,x_j)\) hence \(\Network(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\) as random.

Axiom 2: Finite mean length of routes
=====================================
![Realistic routes should have _controlled length_.](image/SIRSN-length.png){ height=200px }
\note{Here we give the route between Dusseldorf and Bochum. 
\par}

We insist that all routes have finite mean length.

\note[item]{\emph{Obviously} we don't want this route to be infinitely long.}
\note[item]{This requirement provides a parameter for the SIRSN mechanism:
namely the mean length of route between
two nodes separated by unit Euclidean distance.}
\note[item]{This \alert{rules out} the use of Brownian paths!}

Axiom 3: SIRSN property
=======================
![SIRSN routes should be massively re-used.](image/SIRSN-SIRSN.png){ height=125px }
\note{Here we repeat the original display of a network of connections between a number of cities in
the west of Germany and Holland.
\par}

**NB:** \structure{SIRSN} = 
"\structure{S}cale-\structure{i}nvariant \structure{R}andom \structure{S}patial \structure{N}etwork".

We require massive re-use of route components (strong SIRSN property).

. . .

\structure{Weak SIRSN:} Source/terminus nodes spread evenly everywhere on plane. 
"Route-re-use" means mean-network-length-per-unit-area must be finite.
\note[item]{Nodes "spread evenly everywhere": leads to \textbf{weak SIRSN property}.}

. . .

\structure{Strong SIRSN:} Source/terminus nodes spread \alert{densely} everywhere on plane.
"Route-re-use" means 
mean-network-length-per-unit-area is finite
_for "long-distance" network_.
\note[item]{"Long-distance" network: formed by parts of routes at least unit distance from both source and terminus.
\newline
Nodes "spread densely everywhere": \textbf{(strong) SIRSN property}.}

\note[item]{A weaker requirement is to ask for
finite-network-length-per-unit-area (\emph{i.e.} not mean length!): \textbf{pre-SIRSN property}.}

\note[item]{Note that for any of these variant SIRSN properties to make sense, we require finite length of routes as specified
in the second axiom.}

\note[item]{This key property \alert{rules out} the use of complete Euclidean graphs!}

\note[item]{The length intensity of the fibre process of (long-range) routes provides a further SIRSN parameter.}

\note[item]{Contrast Platzman \& Bartholdi (1989): spacefilling curves and travelling salesman problem
\emph{eg} for 15k "cities" over all of Germany.}

Scale-Invariant Random Spatial Networks (SIRSN) {#sec-SIRSN}
===============================================
\structure{Axioms} [following @AldousGanesan-2013; @Aldous-2012].
\note{Aldous introduced these three axioms for a mechanism producing the chosen (think, "fastest") route
\(\Route(x,y)=\Route(y,x)\)
connecting \(x\) and \(y\).
\par}

. . .

\structure{Given:} a (random) network \(\Network(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) \structure{connecting} nodes. \structure{Require:}

1. \structure{Scale-invariance:} for each Euclidean similarity 
\(\Similarity\),
\(\Law{N(\Similarity x_1,\ldots,\Similarity x_n)}=\Law{\Similarity N(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}\).
\note[item]{We need (statistical) scaling symmetry, as well as Euclidean symmetry
(stationarity and isotropy).}

2.  If \(D_1\) is length of fastest route between two points at unit distance apart then
\structure{mean length is finite:} \(\Expect{D_1}<\infty\).
\note[item]{Routes should have finite arc-length.}
    
3.  \structure{Weak SIRSN property:} network connecting points of (independent) unit intensity Poisson point process has finite average length density;  
**or**  
    \structure{(Strong) SIRSN property}: finite length intensity of
    "long-range" routes for points of _dense_ Poisson point process.
\note[item]{On the other hand if one assembles all possible routes between source/destinations spread
out over the entire plane (for example \emph{via} an independent Poisson point process)
then the resulting fibre process of routes should have finite (mean) 
length intensity.}
    
. . .

\structure{Do SIRSN exist at all?}
\note[item]{Russell: "The axiomatic method has many advantages over honest work."
But the axiomatic method requires one to demonstrate consistency! Do there
exist \emph{any} SIRSN?}

. . .

\alert{Yes} (first version): Hierarchical SIRSN [@Aldous-2012],  
a \emph{\alert{randomized}} dense dyadic speed-marked planar _\alert{lattice}_.
\note[item]{Aldous (2014) exhibited a somewhat contrived example,
based on a randomized dense dyadic grid. Fine for people living in New York but
could be criticized as weakly randomized, inelegant, \emph{ad hoc}. As near
as possible to a deterministic model!}


Do SIRSN exist at all? a more natural answer
============================================
\alert{Yes} (second version):
Poisson line process SIRSN: 
planar _and also_ higher dimensions too [@Aldous-2012; @Kendall-2014c; @Kahn-2015].
\note{Aldous (2014) asked whether something could be done using Poisson line processes (Plp).
WSK and Kahn showed this can indeed be done, using "speed" to select routes.


Remarkably, the Plp example extends to all dimensions \(m\geq 2\)!
\par}

. . .

\structure{Construction} uses speed-marked (improper) Plp \(\Pi\).
\note{
Notably, as with other explorations of random spatial networks,
the construction makes use of an \emph{improper} random line process.
In fact the lines are everywhere dense, but differentiated by \emph{speed-marks}.
(There are very many slow lines, but fast lines form locally finite line processes.)
\par}

. . .

\(\Pi\) is governed by an intensity measure \(\varpi_\text{Plp}\) 
on \(\alert<5>{(0,\infty)}\times\alert<4>{\Reals\times[0,\pi)}\),  
scaling speed \(v\to\lambda v\) versus space \(x\to\lambda^{\gamma-1}x\):
\[
{\d}\varpi_\text{Plp}
\quad=\quad
\alert<4>{\half}
\alert<5-8>{(\gamma{-}1) v^{-\gamma} {\d}v }\; 
\alert<4>{{\d}r {\d}\theta}
\qquad \text{(make sure \(\gamma>1\)!)}\,.
\]

. . .

\scriptsize
\structure{NB:} \alert<4>{\(\half{\d}r {\d}\theta\)}: intensity measure for \structure{standard Poisson line process}.  
\pause
\structure{NB} (\(\gamma>1\)): Lines of speed \(\geq1\) form \alert<5>{standard Poisson line process \(\Pi^{(\geq1)}\)}.  
\bigskip

\note{\bigskip
The parameter \(\gamma\) is constrained by \(\gamma>2\). If this fails
then
\newline
\(\gamma<2\): too many fast lines and one can reach infinity in finite time:
\newline
\(\gamma\leq2\): not enough slow lines and one cannot reach arbitrary prescribed points
\emph{off} the line process in finite time.

In practice (see simulations) the interesting regime is that
of small \(\gamma>2\).

NB: \(\gamma>m\) required in \(m\)-dimensional space. Use
\(\gamma=(m-1)(\Index-1)+1\) to separate dimension from scaling index.
\par}

. . .

\normalsize
Use fastest \(\Pi\)-paths for routes. Require \(\gamma>2\) so

* \(\Pi\)-paths cannot reach \(\infty\) in finite time;  
* \(\Pi\)-paths can reach any prescribed point in finite time.

. . .

Proving \(\Pi\) forms a SIRSN is non-trivial!



(II) From lines to (non-infinite) fibres
========================================
But we want to be able to model networks like this:  

![](image/SouthAmericaRoadsDark.jpg){height=275px} 

\note{The illustration depicts every road from six-lane motorway to dirt track on the South American continent. 
Note that some kind of general spatial dependence is absolutely required.
I cannot see how to make a simple modification of the Plp-SIRSN to model this situation, 
because lines necessarily have infinite extent. 
(Meaning, no short roads, no curved roads, no convenient model for spatial dependence of any local kind.)

\par
\bigskip

This strongly motivates the development of new SIRSN models which:
\par}
\note[item]{involve segments not lines (thus localizable, facilitating modelling of inhomogeneity);}
\note[item]{and preferably use curved fibres rather than linear segments.}

Sticks and stiff fibres: foundations 
====================================
\note[item]{Object process: classical idea from stochastic geometry.}
\note[item]{"Soup": borrowed to indicate scale-invariant model, 
but not (as far as I can tell) related to any process resembling a LERW.}
\note[item]{One-dimensional objects, so length makes sense (and eventually SIRSN property is not invalidated!),}
Use _object processes_ (random objects located at points of a Poisson process):  

::: {.incremental}

* \alert<9>{Scale-invariant}, so speed-marked ("object soup");
* Sticks or \(C^1\) fibres, so notion of length;
* _Stiff_ fibres (each fibre within \(\eps\) of its intrinsic overall direction).
* Define using intensity measure on \structure{configuration space}:
\note[item]{Everything depends on formulating a configuration space and a \(\sigma\)-finite invariant measure.
All calculations flow from this (typically a calculation is about computing or estimating the probability of \emph{absence} of objects falling in a suitable set).
For this reason, a precise formulating of configuration space is crucial.}
\[
\begin{aligned}
\begin{matrix}
\Reals^m &\times& \RotationGroup_m &\times& (0,\infty) &\times& \Shape &\times& (0,\infty)
\\
x && \omega && r && \alert<6>{\shape} && v
\\
\text{(location)} && 
                 \text{(rotation)} && 
                                \text{(\alert<7>{length})} &&
                                      \text{} && 
                                      \text{(speed)}
\end{matrix}
\end{aligned}
\]
* Parameters: 
  - fibre \alert<6>{shape} distribution;
\note[item]{Statistical shape (exactly the DGK notion) is trivial for sticks!}
  - \alert<7>{rescaled length} distribution (joint with shape);
  - \alert<8>{specific length intensity} \(\lambda\) for set of fibres of more than unit speed;
  - \alert<9>{scaling index} \(\gamma\).
\note[item]{Usually set \(\lambda=1\) for \emph{standard} soup.}

:::

Sticks and stiff fibres: techniques
===================================

1. Integrate the measurable field of orientations using Lipschitz paths;
\note[item]{Measurable so massive non-uniqueness. Speculate about turbulence?!}
2. Sobolev compactness theorem for Lipschitz paths: hence existence of "geodesics" (fastest connecting paths);
\note[item]{Follows linear theory very closely.}
3. For routes, select geodesics in scale-invariant way using auxiliary scale-invariant randomness;
\note[item]{Let each fibre support a random dense Poisson point process marked by positive "priorities" so that low values are locally finite.}
4. Validation of SIRSN axioms depends on comparison of (fractional power) of connection
time with Exponential distribution.
\note[item]{Validation of SIRSN axioms depends on little more than this comparison once uniqueness of routes is assured!}

. . .

Finesse away percolation issues by supposing fibre soup is _thick_:
scaled length distribution has finite first moment but infinite second moment (quantified by tail condition)
\note[item]{This finesse is probably not required, but allows us not to be distracted by hard technicalities.}

. . .

and do the sums for 

* probability of "timely" connection of two close points by a single fibre;
* concatenating point-pairs for "timely" connection of two far points;
* deriving exponential moment of fractional power(connection time);
* deriving estimate on "time-diameter" for compact set.
\note[item]{You've probably guessed, 
the heart of the matter now is to study a stick-based first-passage percolation problem.}

(III) Beyond thickness: percolation
===================================

The SIRSN property should not need "thickness" (single-fibre connection).

. . .

::: {.conjecture}
## Conjecture: Super-critical percolation suffices
I conjecture that a Poisson soup of stiff fibres can form a SIRSN 
if the family of fibres of greater than unit speed exhibits super-critical percolation.
:::

\note{I can sketch a proof of SIRSN property for highly percolative stiff non-thick fibre soups, based on
(a very inefficient) comparison with bond percolation.
\par

The conjecture seems reasonable, but is expressed in deliberately bold terms.
\par

Note that Popov and Vachkovskaia (2002) exhibit a "discretely-scale-invariant" 
or multi-scale stick model for which percolation fails!

Conclusion
==========

::: {.incremental}
* Strong positive evidence that "SIRSN are everywhere!" (not just when infinite lines are involved).
\note[item]{We've progressed from having just two somewhat unrealistic models to possessing a whole Poisson plethora of possibilities!}
* There are very simple scale-invariant stick soups which are thick:  
so this theory is not vacuous!
\note[item]{The simple examples are based on Pareto distribution for scaled-stick-length, 
hence "Poisson-Pareto thick stick soup"!}

* Future prospects:
\note[item]{Many interesting theoretical questions. For example, no known examples yet
of pre-SIRSN that are not SIRSN, or weak SIRSN that are not strong SIRSN!}
    - traffic, benchmark models for traffic flow [cf @Gameros-2017];
\note[item]{Aldous (2014) proposes a scale-invariant traffic flow.}
    - adding spatial inhomogeneity;
\note[item]{Superimpose a regional variation on a scale-invariant model.}
    - moving beyond Poisson, _eg_ adding simple interactions.
\note[item]{Weak interactions, or scale-invariant versions of tessellations, or Markov chain interlacements, or determinantal point processes, or \ldots}
