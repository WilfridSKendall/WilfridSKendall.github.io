## Wandering around a fibrous network when all the paths look very much alike

### Wilfrid Stephen Kendall, Wednesday 29 May 2024[^1]

### Abstract

I will give an overview of work I have been interested in for the last decade or so, concerned with generating models based on Poisson processes which supply insight into route-finding and traffic flows. Initial constructions (Aldous 2014, Kahn 2016, WSK 2017) showed existence of such models satisfying the SIRSN axioms formulated by Aldous (2014). But these constructions all involve infinitely long linear paths, and in particular do not easily admit local influences. Can one do better? I shall discuss recent work showing that SIRSN can indeed arise under far less stringent conditions, based on line segments or even suitably stiff fibres.

## Implementation details

This talk lasts between 20 and 30 minutes. 

Main file is `Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk.qmd`; combined with `Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk.bib` this produces `Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk.pdf` _etc_.

What to do to make things work: 
issue command `make full` on `bash` commandline. This produces  `Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk.pdf` ,  `Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk-handout.pdf` ,  Short-`Fibre-SIRSN-talk-handout-2x2.pdf` .
