abstract = {We consider random walks associated with conductances on Delaunay triangulations, Gabriel graphs and skeletons of Voronoi tilings which are generated by point processes in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}. Under suitable assumptions on point processes and conductances, we show that, for almost any realization of the point process, these random walks are recurrent if {\$}d=2{\$} and transient if {\$}d\backslashgeq 3{\$}. These results hold for a large variety of point processes including Poisson point processes, Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster and Mat{\'{e}}rn hardcore processes which have clustering or repulsive properties. In order to prove them, we state general criteria for recurrence or almost sure transience which apply to random graphs embedded in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}.},
annote = {From AMS MR:

This paper considers random walks on spatial graphs generated by point processes in Rd. The graphs considered are the Delaunay triangulation, the Gabriel graph and the skeleton of the Voronoi tiling, while the results apply to point processes satisfying a number of conditions but including homogeneous Poisson point processes, Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster and hardcore processes, and, for recurrence only, determinantal point processes.
The full results allow conductances on the edges which may depend on the graph structure. In two dimensions, it is shown that as long as the conductances are bounded above, for almost all realisations of the point process the random walk is recurrent. Similarly, in three dimensions it is shown that as long as the conductances are bounded below or are a decreasing positive function of the edge lengths, then for almost all realisations of the point process the random walk is transient.
The proofs work via electrical network–based methods. For recurrence, a criterion similar to the Nash-Williams criterion for recurrence is developed, and it is shown that the graphs of interest almost surely satisfy this criterion. For transience, a criterion is developed for there to be a rough embedding of an infinite percolation cluster to the graph of interest. It is shown that the graphs of interest on homogeneous Poisson point processes and Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster and hardcore processes satisfy this criterion. Then the transience of infinite percolation clusters gives the result.

abstract = {In this paper, we study invariant Poisson processes of lines (i.e, bi-infinite geodesics) in the {\$}3{\$}-regular tree. More precisely, there exists a unique (up to multiplicative constant) locally finite Borel measure on the space of lines that is invariant under graph automorphisms, and we consider two Poissonian ways of playing with this invariant measure. First, following Benjamini, Jonasson, Schramm and Tykesson, we consider an invariant Poisson process of lines, and show that there is a critical value of the intensity below which a.s. the vacant set of the process percolates, and above which all its connected components are finite. Then, we consider an invariant Poisson process of roads (i.e, lines with speed limits), and show that there is a critical value of the parameter governing the speed limits of the roads below which a.s. one can drive to infinity in finite time using the road network generated by the process, and above which this is impossible.},

abstract = {Consider the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the complete graph with n vertices, when edges are assigned independent random weights. Endow this tree with the graph distance renormalized by n1/3 and with the uniform measure on its vertices. We show that the resulting space converges in distribution as n→∞to a random compact measured metric space in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology.We additionally show that the limit is a random binary ℝ-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling between the MST problem and the Erdo[double acute]s-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph. We exploit the explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erdo[double acute]s-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph in the so-called critical window, established in [Probab. Theory Related Fields 152 (2012) 367-406], and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a "critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the notion of ℝ-graphs, which generalise ℝ-trees, and are of independent interest.},

abstract = {The success of lottery ticket initializations (Frankle and Carbin, 2019) suggests that small, sparsified networks can be trained so long as the network is initialized appropriately. Unfortunately, finding these "winning ticket" initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets. We also found that winning ticket initializations generalize across optimizers with high performance. These results suggest that winning ticket initializations generated by sufficiently large datasets contain inductive biases generic to neural networks more broadly which improve training across many settings and provide hope for the development of better initialization methods.},

abstract = {Recent statistical methods fitted on large-scale GPS data can provide accurate estimations of the expected travel time between two points. However, little is known about the distribution of travel time, which is key to decision-making across a number of logistic problems. With sufficient data, single road-segment travel time can be well approximated. The challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate such information over a route to arrive at the route-distribution of travel time. We develop a novel statistical approach to this problem. We show that, under general conditions, without assuming a distribution of speed, travel time {\{}divided by route distance follows a Gaussian distribution with route-invariant population mean and variance. We develop efficient inference methods for such parameters and propose asymptotically tight population prediction intervals for travel time. Using traffic flow information, we further develop a trip-specific Gaussian-based predictive distribution, resulting in tight prediction intervals for short and long trips. Our methods, implemented in an R-package, are illustrated in a real-world case study using mobile GPS data, showing that our trip-specific and population intervals both achieve the 95$\backslash${\%} theoretical coverage levels. Compared to alternative approaches, our trip-specific predictive distribution achieves (a) the theoretical coverage at every level of significance, (b) tighter prediction intervals, (c) less predictive bias, and (d) more efficient estimation and prediction procedures. This makes our approach promising for low-latency, large-scale transportation applications.}},

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be ‘shorter' than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension d42, which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads.

abstract = {Standard MCMC methods can scale poorly to big data settings due to the need to evaluate the likelihood at each iteration. There have been a number of approximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this computational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer target the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte Carlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of (Bierkens, Roberts, 2017), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov process. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction (a property which is known to inhibit rapid convergence) the Zig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative which we observe to often have favourable convergence properties. We show how the Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an {\{}$\backslash$em exact approximate scheme{\}}, i.e. the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the variance of our unbiased estimator, then the Zig-Zag process can be super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the size of the data.},

We divide the image into a set of scanning windows and classify them into two clusters: homogeneous material and anomaly. Based on a sample of estimated local fibre directions, for each scanning window we compute several classification attributes, namely the coordinate wise means of local fibre directions, the entropy of the directional distribution, and a combination of them. We also propose a new spatial modification of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm. Besides the clustering we also consider testing the significance of anomalies. To this end, we apply a change point technique for random fields and derive the exact inequalities for tail probabilities of a test statistic. The proposed methodology is first validated on simulated images. Finally, it is applied to a 3D image of a fibre reinforced polymer.},

abstract = {We study uniform spanning forest measures on infinite graphs. which are weak limits of uniform spanning tree measures from finite subgraphs. These limits can be taken with free (FSF) or wired (WSF) boundary conditions. Pemantle proved that the free and wired spanning forests coincide in Z(d) and that they give a single tree iff d less than or equal to 4.In the present work, we extend Pemantle's alternative to general graphs and exhibit further connections of uniform spanning forests to random walks, potential theory, invariant percolation and amenability. The uniform spanning forest model is related to random cluster models in statistical physics, but, because of the preceding connections, its analysis can be carried further. Among our results are the following:The FSF and WSF in a graph G coincide iff all harmonic Dirichlet functions on G are constant.The tail sigma -fields of the WSF and the FSF are trivial on any graph.On any Cayley graph that is not a finite extension of Z, all component trees of the WSF have one end; this is new in Z(d) for d greater than or equal to 5.On any tree, as well as on any graph with spectral radius less than 1, a.s. all components of the WSF are recurrent.The basic topology of the free and the wired uniform spanning forest measures on lattices in hyperbolic space H-d is analyzed.A Cayley graph is amenable iff for all epsilon {\textgreater} 0, the union of the WSF and Bernoulli percolation with parameter E is connected.Harmonic measure from infinity is shown to exist on any recurrent proper planar graph with finite codegrees.We also present numerous open problems and conjectures.},

Previous investigation and simulations strongly suggest that the colored regions converge (in some sense) to a random partition of the plane. We prove a weak version of this, showing that normalized empirical measures converge to Lebesgue measures on a random partition into measurable sets. Topological properties remain an open problem. In the course of the proof, which heavily exploits time-reversals, we encounter a novel self-similar process of coalescing planar partitions. In this process, sets A(z) in the partition are associated with Poisson random points z, and the dynamics are as follows. Points are deleted randomly at rate 1; when z is deleted, its set A(z) is adjoined to the set A(z0) of the nearest other point z0. MSC codes 60D05},

abstract = {There is an epistemological divide in the field of road network analysis, concerning the way network distance should be conceptualized. On one hand, the generality of studies in the field adopt metric distance as a self-evident choice. On the other, space syntax studies adopt a different distance concept, namely that of angular distance, which ignores actual physical lengths. Theoretically, these two distance concepts imply quite different assumptions. Analytically, they produce also different results. In this paper we assess the differences between these two network distance concepts, using a model of the UK's complete road network (2,031,971 nodes) and a very large dataset of vehicular movement counts (20,752 locations). We describe the statistical associations between observed vehicular flows and the betweenness centrality of the road-network nodes where such flows were measured, the latter calculated with metric and angular distance functions, across a number of increasing radii. Relations to road capacity are also discussed in principal roads where this is known. The geographical comprehensiveness of our model and the size of our movement sample allow us to state, with unprecedented statistical validity, the clear outperformance of angular distance over metric distance, in what concerns the strength of the studied correlations. This is true for all types of roads (urban and non- urban) and for all motorized vehicles, representing 99.05{\%} of the total traffic; the remaining 0.95{\%} correspond to pedal cycles, which yielded inconclusive results. We also demonstrate the existence of two distinct regimes of association between movement and centrality, conspicuous in cities but altogether absent in non-urban areas, which represent new evidence supporting space syntax's dual model of urban form.},

abstract = {How do pedestrians choose their paths within city street networks? Human path planning has been extensively studied at the aggregate level of mobility flows, and at the individual level with strictly designed behavioural experiments. However, a comprehensive, individual-level model of how humans select pedestrian paths in real urban environments is still lacking. Here, we analyze human path planning behaviour in a large dataset of individual pedestrians, whose GPS traces were continuously recorded as they pursued their daily goals. Through statistical analysis we reveal two robust empirical discoveries, namely that (1) people increasingly deviate from the shortest path as the distance between origin and destination increases, and (2) individual choices exhibit direction-dependent asymmetries when origin and destination are swapped. In order to address the above findings, which cannot be explained by existing models, we develop a vector-based navigation framework motivated by the neural evidence of direction-encoding cells in hippocampal brain networks, and by behavioural evidence of vector navigation in animals. Modelling pedestrian path preferences by vector-based navigation increases the model's predictive power by 35{\%}, compared to a model based on minimizing distance with stochastic effects. We show that these empirical findings and modelling results generalise across two major US cities with drastically different street networks, suggesting that vector-based navigation is a universal property of human path planning, independent of specific city environments. Our results offer a simple, unified explanation of numerous findings about human navigation, and posit a computational mechanism that may underlie the human capacity to efficiently navigate in environments at various scales.},

We investigate the typical shortest path length of the resulting marked point process, which is an important characteristic e.g. in performance analysis and planning of telecommunication networks.

abstract = {Studies of functional MRI data are increasingly
concerned with the estimation of dif- ferences in spatio-temporal
networks across groups of subjects or experimental conditions.
Unsupervised clustering and independent component analysis (ICA)
have been used to iden- tify such spatio-temporal networks. While
these approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at
the subject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental
conditions re- quire further methodological development. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by showing how self-organizing maps
(SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean inferential framework.
Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a Frechet mean
with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. The advantage of
this approach is twofold. Firstly, it allows the visualization of
the mean SOM in each experimental condition. Secondly, this
Frechean ap- proach permits one to draw inference on group
differences, using permutation of the group labels. We consider
the use of different distance functions, and introduce two
extensions of the classical sum of minimum distance (SMD) between
two SOMs, which take into account the spatio-temporal pattern of
the fMRI data. The validity of these methods is illustrated on
synthetic data. Through these simulations, we show that the three
distance functions of interest behave as expected, in the sense
that the ones capturing temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal
aspects of the SOMs are more likely to reach significance under
simulated scenarios characterized by temporal, spatial and
spatio-temporal differences, respectively. In addition, a
re-analysis of a classical experiment on visually-triggered
emotions demonstrates the usefulness of this methodology. In this
study, the multivariate functional patterns typi- cal of the
subjects exposed to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli are found to
be more similar than the ones of the subjects exposed to
emotionally neutral stimuli. In this re-analysis, the group-level
SOM output units with the smallest sample Jaccard indices were
compared with standard GLM group-specific z-score maps, and
provided considerable levels of agree- ment. Taken together, these
results indicate that our proposed methods can cast new light on
existing data by adopting a global analytical perspective on
functional MRI paradigms.},

abstract = {Stochastic geometry has in recent years experienced considerable progress, both in its applications to other sciences and engineering, and in its theoretical foundations and mathematical expansion. This book, by two eminent specialists of the subject, provides a solid mathematical treatment of the basic models of stochastic geometry - random sets, point processes of geometric objects (particles, flats), and random mosaics. It develops, in a measure-theoretic setting, the integral geometry for the motion and the translation group, as needed for the investigation of these models under the usual invariance assumptions. A characteristic of the book is the interplay between stochastic and geometric arguments, leading to various major results. Its main theme, once the foundations have been laid, is the quantitative investigation of the basic models. This comprises the introduction of suitable parameters, in the form of functional densities, relations between them, and approaches to their estimation. Much additional information on stochastic geometry is collected in the section notes.},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
annote = {This book has been published in the series "Probability and its Applications''. The book starts with a preface that does an excellent job of setting the scene and explaining the contents. In particular, it introduces the reader to the main aims of the book: (1) to give a sound mathematical foundation for the most basic and general models of stochastic geometry; (2) to consider the parts of integral geometry that are relevant for the applications in stochastic geometry (i.e. selected concepts from integral geometry are tailored for use in stochastic geometry); (3) to demonstrate such applications. The book consists of the following four parts: (I) Foundations of Stochastic Geometry, (II) Integral Geometry, (III) Selected Topics from Stochastic Geometry and (IV) Appendix, and contains 14 chapters. Chapter 1, titled "Prolog'', is devoted to explaining the main structure of the book. Since the book is about relations between stochastic geometry and integral geometry, the authors begin with an imaginary experiment that leads to a basic model of stochastic geometry. The presentation of stochastic geometry in the book is restricted to the aims of laying a sound foundation for the standard models of stochastic geometry and of preparing and describing the use of integral geometry. Therefore, in Section 1.2 the authors provide pointers to additional supplementary literature. 
   The first part, "Foundations of Stochastic Geometry'', is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 2, titled "Random closed sets'', is an introduction to general random closed sets in a topological space E. The basic space E is assumed to be locally compact and to have a countable base. Section 2.1 considers the system F of its closed subsets, equipped with the topology of closed convergence and the induced $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets. The distribution of a random closed set is completely determined by certain hitting probabilities, in particular, by its capacity functional. This gives, for every compact set C⊂E, the probability that the random set has nonempty intersection with C. The capacity functional can be seen in a certain analogy to the distribution function of a real random variable. Like distribution functions, the possible capacity functionals can be completely characterized. This characterization is provided by the Choquet theorem; a proof of this result can be found in Section 2.2. Some applications of this theorem are treated in Section 2.3. Special features of random closed sets in Euclidean spaces are the subject of Section 2.4. Chapter 3, titled "Point processes'', considers point processes and marked point processes. In Section 3.1 point processes are introduced as random counting measures and therefore general random measures are treated as well. Poisson processes are the subject of Section 3.2. Palm distributions of random measures and point processes are treated, with two different approaches, in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Section 3.5, on marked point processes, lays some foundations for the treatment of geometric models. Section 3.6 represents point processes of closed sets. Chapter 4, titled "Geometric models'', is devoted to the study of geometric processes in Rd and the random sets derived from them. A geometric process in Rd is a point process of closed sets which is concentrated on geometrically distinguished subclasses of F (= the system of nonempty closed subsets of E). Section 4.1 considers particle processes. Section 4.2 establishes a connection between particle processes and marked point processes (in particular, the germ-grain processes, where compact sets serve as marks). Section 4.3 considers an important example of random closed sets, the germ-grain models which are generated from germ-grain processes. The Boolean models, derived from Poisson processes, are an especially tractable subclass. Section 4.4 is devoted to flat processes. Of particular interest are the processes arising from flat processes by intersections, either with a fixed plane or by intersecting fixed numbers of the flats in the process. Some assertions about the intensities and the directional distributions of these derived processes are obtained, mainly in the case of Poisson processes. Special cases of fiber and surface processes are treated in Section 4.5. Section 4.6 is concerned with a set-valued parameter, which can be attached to different processes of geometric objects. 
   The second part, "Integral Geometry'', is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 5, titled "Averaging with invariant measures'', develops the basic tools, namely intersection formulas for fixed and moving geometric objects, where suitable geometric quantities of the intersections are integrated with respect to invariant measures. The main purpose of Section 5.1 is the calculation of general kinematic integrals of the form 
∫Gd$\phi$(K∩gM)$\mu$(dg)
for convex bodies K, M in Rd, where Gd is the motion group of Rd, and the integration is with respect to its Haar measure $\mu$. The integral takes a simple form if the functional $\phi$ satisfies two natural assumptions, additivity and continuity. This result is known as Hadwiger's general integral geometric theorem (see Theorem 5.1.2). The assumptions on $\phi$ are satisfied, in particular, by the intrinsic volumes Vj. The purpose of the two subsequent sections is a derivation of the principal kinematic formula for curvature measures. Section 5.2 treats only integrations over the translation group, and Section 5.3 then deals with the additional integrations over the rotation group. Section 5.4 leaves the domain of convex or polyconvex (that is, can be represented as a finite union of convex bodies) sets and studies translative, kinematic and Crofton formulas for Hausdorff rectifiable sets and the Hausdorff measures of their intersections. Chapter 6, titled "Extended concepts of integral geometry'', derives further integral geometric formulas for convex bodies. In Sections 6.1 and 6.2, versions of the principal kinematic formula are obtained. Section 6.3 derives a local kinematic formula and also a formula that combines sections with projections. Section 6.4 is devoted to a continuation on translative integral geometry. The authors treat iterated translative formulas, which involve a more general series of mixed measures, and consider rotation means and results of Crofton type for the mixed measures. The integral formulas for mixed measures and their global versions, the mixed functionals, also yield kinematic formulas for certain mixed volumes and for projection functions and support functions of convex bodies. Section 6.5 provides an introduction to the integral geometry of spherically convex sets in the spherical space Sd−1. Chapter 7, titled "Integral geometric transformations'', is devoted to transformation formulas for integrals over various spaces of geometric objects. In principle, the required transformation formulas are just versions of the transformation rule for multiple integrals under differentiable mappings. However, since the mappings are defined by geometric operations, the Jacobians have geometric interpretations, and therefore direct geometric arguments are often simpler than the use of special parameterizations. The transformation formulas have various applications in stochastic geometry, for example, in the investigation of convex hulls of random points (Chapter 8), and the study of random mosaics (Chapter 10). The first section provides simple rules for invariant measures on flag spaces. In Section 7.2 Blaschke-Petkantschin formulas are proved. In Section 7.3 two formulas of Blaschke-Petkantschin type are proved, where the pivots are spheres. 
   The third part, "Selected Topics from Stochastic Geometry'', is divided into 4 chapters. Chapter 8, titled "Some geometric probability problems'', is devoted to selected geometric probability problems. Section 8.1 provides early historical examples of geometric probability problems. Section 8.2 considers convex hulls of random points. Section 8.3 applies spherical integral geometry to random projections of polytopes, and Section 8.4 treats randomly moving convex bodies and flats by means of Euclidean integral geometry. Section 8.5 develops a theory of randomly touching convex bodies. Section 8.6 is devoted to various inequalities for geometric probabilities and expectations of geometric random variables related to convex bodies. Chapter 9, titled "Mean values for random sets'', returns to the mainstream of the book and proceeds with a quantitative treatment of stationary random closed sets and particle processes. Section 9.1 shows how some characteristic parameters of random closed sets specialize in the case of stationary (and possibly isotropic) Boolean models, in particular, those with convex grains, and then appear in rather explicit formulas. The main purpose of Section 9.2 is the specification of a class of stationary random sets Z (with locally polyconvex realizations) and a class of functionals $\phi$ (defined on polyconvex sets) such that the limit 
$\phi$¯¯¯(Z):=limr→∞E$\phi$(Z∩rW)Vd(rW)
exists for every convex body W with the volume Vd(W){\textgreater}0 (here E is the mathematical expectation). The parameter $\phi$¯¯¯(Z) is called the $\phi$-density of Z. Important (but not the only) examples of functionals satisfying the assumptions are the intrinsic volumes (or Minkowski functionals) V0,{\ldots},Vd−1. It may even happen, under suitable assumptions, that the limit limr→∞$\phi$(Z∩rW)Vd(rW) exists P-almost surely and is a constant, which is then equal to $\phi$¯¯¯(Z). This ergodic approach to densities is described in Section 9.3. In Section 9.4, results from integral geometry are employed to derive various formulas which are useful in density estimation from observations of realizations of the random set within a bounded sampling window, or from observations in a lower-dimensional section. Mathematical principles of further estimation procedures are the topic of Section 9.5. Chapter 10, titled "Random mosaics'', gives a detailed treatment of stationary random mosaics, another basic model of stochastic geometry. After a careful introduction (Section 10.1), particular attention is paid to tessellations induced by stationary Poisson processes, either as Voronoĭ or Delaunay tessellations corresponding to Poisson point processes (Section 10.2), or as hyperplane tessellations generated by a Poisson process in the space of hyperplanes (Section 10.3). Zero cells and typical cells of stationary random mosaics provide interesting examples of random polytopes and are studied in some detail (Section 10.4). Section 10.5 proves mixing properties of special mosaics induced by stationary Poisson processes. In particular, stationary Voronoĭ and Delaunay mosaics are mixing (see Theorems 10.5.1 and 10.5.2). Chapter 11, titled "Non-stationarity models'', is an outlook to non-stationary models for particle processes and Boolean models (Section 11.1), for processes of flats (Section 11.3) and for random mosaics (Section 11.4). In Section 11.2 the authors continue the investigation of general Boolean models Z with convex grains and consider generalized contact distributions. 
   The fourth part, titled "Appendix'', is divided into 3 chapters. The appendix collects basic material from other fields that is needed in the different chapters of the book. Chapter 12, titled "Facts from general topology'', deals with results and facts from topology and Borel measures (Section 12.1). Section 12.2 collects basic notions and results on the topology of the space of closed sets. Section 12.3 considers the special case where the underlying space E is Rd, the d-dimensional Euclidean space, and shows additional features, due to the linear structure of Rd and the properties of its standard metric. Chapter 13, titled "Invariant measures'', is devoted to Haar measures. In Section 13.1 invariance refers to a group operation and thus to a homogeneous space. In Section 13.2, the transformation groups and homogeneous spaces that occur in Euclidean integral geometry are introduced. In Section 13.3 the reader can find a proof of a general uniqueness theorem for relatively invariant measures. Chapter 14, titled "Facts from convex geometry'', is devoted to the geometry of convex bodies. Section 14.1 considers the subspace determinant. Section 14.2 considers the rigid motion invariant intrinsic volumes and their local counterparts, the curvature measures. Section 14.3 is devoted to mixed volumes. Section 14.4 provides general information about additive functionals. Section 14.5 is devoted to Hausdorff measures and rectifiable sets. The appendix may be used as a quick reference source for a number of mathematical concepts that are also useful well outside the scope of this book. The book presents a number of results that are otherwise scattered among an immense number of research papers and mostly provides full proofs for them. Every section ends with bibliographical and historical notes which broaden the perspective and discuss each particular section. The most remarkable aspect of the book is the reader-friendly structure and the style in which it has been written. The book is also worth owning not only for those working in stochastic geometry and immediately related fields of theoretical and applied probability and spatial statistics. With its treatment of probability theory, Haar measures on the topological groups and convex geometry, the book is intended for readers from these fields as well. Each chapter starts with a short introduction in which some of the main references for the topics covered in the chapter are listed. The reader is alerted as to what material from the chapter is required reading and what is not. This book has a good index and index of notations, and a very detailed bibliography (838 references). The importance of the book, from both a practical and theoretical standpoint, is unquestionable. This book, by two eminent specialists of stochastic and integral geometry, will be an essential part of every mathematical library. Reviewed by V. K. Ohanyan

In some applications data sets consist of spatial point patterns clustered along or around a latent system of fibres or curves. The authors give several examples and investigate two real data sets in more detail (earthquake epicenters clustered around seismic faults and sweat pores in fingerprints along the ridges). A new approach to analyzing these data is introduced. To each point in the observation window an undirected orientation is assigned. In such a way, a family of fibres is described by an orientation field. In order to estimate this field from the data, an empirical Bayes approach is utilized. Sampling from the posterior distribution of the fibres is accomplished by the birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Reviewed by Zbyn{\v{e}}k Pawlas},

abstract = {Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90{\%}, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the lottery ticket hypothesis: dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (winning tickets) that-when trained in isolation-reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20{\%} of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

Our notion is robust enough to allow the flow to continue past these singularities. As a crucial tool for this purpose we study the heat flow on such singular time-dependent weighted graphs with changing graph structure. We then give several equivalent characterizations of super Ricci flows in terms of a discrete dynamic Bochner inequality, gradient and transport estimates for the heat flow, and dynamic convexity of the entropy along discrete optimal transport paths. The latter property can be used to show that our notion of super Ricci flow is consistent with classical super Ricci flows for manifolds (or metric measure spaces) in a discrete to continuum limit.},

Existence of the processes, as well as their sample path regularity properties are derived. The model class in particular contains differentiable Gaussian processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a valid differentiable Gaussian field on general compact metric graphs. We then focus on a model subclass which we show contains processes with Markov properties. For this case, we show how to evaluate finite dimensional distributions of the process exactly and computationally efficiently. This facilitates using the proposed models for statistical inference without the need for any approximations. Finally, we derive some of the main statistical properties of the model class, such as consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters and asymptotic optimality properties of linear prediction based on the model with misspecified parameters.},

abstract = {Road network robustness is the ability of a road network to operate correctly under a wide range of attacks. A structural robustness analysis can describe the survivability of a city road network that is under attack and can help improve functions such as urban planning and emergency response. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to quantitatively evaluate road network robustness based on the community structure derived from a city road network, in which communities refer to those densely connected sub- sets of nodes that are sparsely linked to the remaining network. First, a road network is reconstructed into a set of connected communities. Then, successive simulated attacks are conducted on the recon- structed road networks to test the performance of the networks under attack. The performance of the networks is represented by efficiency and the occurrence of fragmentation. Three attack strategies, including a random attack and two intentional attacks, are performed to evaluate the survivability of the road network under different situations. Contrary to the traditional road segment-based approach, the community-based robustness analysis on a city road network shows distinct structural diversity between communities, providing greater insight into network vulnerability under intentional attacks. Six typical city road networks on three different continents are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The evaluation results reveal an important feature of the structure of city road networks from a community-based perspective, i.e., that the structure is robust under random failure but fragile under intentional attack. This result is highly consistent in different city road network forms.},

abstract = {The Brownian loop soup introduced in Lawler and Werner (2004) is a Poissonian realization from a sigma-finite measure on unrooted loops. This measure satisfies both conformal invariance and a restriction property. In this paper, we define a random walk loop soup and show that it converges to the Brownian loop soup. In fact, we give a strong approximation result making use of the strong approximation result of Koml$\backslash$'os, Major, and Tusn$\backslash$'ady. To make the paper self-contained, we include a proof of the approximation result that we need.},

This requires working in the continuum plane. We introduce an axiomatization of a class of processes we call {\{}$\backslash$em scale-invariant random spatial networks{\}}, whose primitives are routes between each pair of points in the plane. We prove that one concrete model, based on minimum-time routes in a binary hierarchy of roads with different speed limits, satisfies the axioms, and note informally that two other constructions (based on Poisson line processes and on dynamic proximity graphs) are expected also to satisfy the axioms. We initiate study of structure theory and summary statistics for general processes in this class.},

We focus on geodesics, the paths traced out by a particle traveling in this quenched random environment. By taking the point of the view of the particle, we show that the law of its observed environment is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the random metric, and we provide an explicit form for its Radon-Nikodym derivative. We use this result to prove a "local Markov property" along an unbounded geodesic, demonstrating that it eventually encounters any type of geometric phenomenon. We also develop in this paper some general results on conditional Gaussian measures. Our Main Theorem states that a geodesic chosen with random initial conditions (chosen independently of the metric) is almost surely not minimizing. To demonstrate this, we show that a minimizing geodesic is guaranteed to eventually pass over a certain "bump surface," which locally has constant positive curvature. By using Jacobi fields, we show that this is sufficient to destabilize the minimizing property. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It is shown that if such a set is stationary with respect to a transitive (locally compact) group of symmetries then any event which concerns the random set itself (rather than accidental details of its construction) must have probability zero or one. Indeed the result requires only quasi-stationarity (null-events stay null under the group action). In passing, it is noted that the property of being countable does not correspond to a measurable subset of the space of subsets of an uncountably infinite Polish space.},

Such metrics appear naturally in discretisations of W2-gradient flow formulations for dissipative PDE. However, it has recently been shown that these metrics do not in general converge to W2, unless strong geometric constraints are imposed on the discrete mesh. In this paper we prove that, in a 1-dimensional periodic setting, discrete transport metrics converge to a limiting transport metric with a non-trivial effective mobility. This mobility depends sensitively on the geometry of the mesh and on the non-local mobility at the discrete level. Our result quantifies to what extent discrete transport can make use of microstructure in the mesh to reduce the cost of transport.},

Every mathematician with some knowledge of stochastic processes is aware of the interest and importance of the Poisson process. Its description is usually found in books on stochastic processes or point processes, but typically scattered through several different chapters. Therefore it is very useful to have now a book which is devoted to a systematic treatment of Poisson processes. The book under review fulfills the expectations one might have when a famous elder author writes a book on a classic topic. It gives the basic facts in a clear and lucid way. It is shown how the theory can be applied to interesting problems of astronomy, queueing and traffic, etc., and these examples are studied very thoroughly and deeply, giving even the specialist new insights. Thus, the book is an excellent basis for lectures or seminars; the reviewer also believes that this book can be a valuable gift for a young mathematician to stimulate his or her interest in stochastic processes and in applied probability in general. 
   The chapter headings follow: 1. Stochastic models for random sets of points, 2. Poisson processes in general spaces, 3. Sums over Poisson processes, 4. Poisson processes on the line, 5. Marked Poisson processes, 6. Cox processes, 7. Stochastic geometry, 8. Completely random measures, 9. The Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. 
   It can be seen that this book presents nearly all the material one might expect (if statistics is excluded). It is important that the multidimensional process be considered as well as the one-dimensional one. Nevertheless, the reviewer wonders why the author does not discuss the simulation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson processes. Furthermore, the term "thinning'' deserves more explicit discussion. Its application to the derivation of the formula for the capacity functional of the Boolean model (of the theory of random closed sets) would then be a further example in Chapter 7.

abstract = {The paper concerns lattice triangulations, that is, triangulations of the integer points in a polygon in ℝ2$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}} whose vertices are also integer points. Lattice triangulations have been studied extensively both as geometric objects in their own right and by virtue of applications in algebraic geometry. Our focus is on random triangulations in which a triangulation $\sigma$$\backslash$sigma has weight $\lambda$|$\sigma$|$\backslash$lambda{\^{}}{\{}|$\backslash$sigma|{\}}, where $\lambda$$\backslash$lambda is a positive real parameter, and |$\sigma$||$\backslash$sigma| is the total length of the edges in $\sigma$$\backslash$sigma. Empirically, this model exhibits a “phase transition” at $\lambda$=1$\backslash$lambda=1 (corresponding to the uniform distribution): for $\lambda${\textless}1$\backslash$lambda{\textless}1 distant edges behave essentially independently, while for $\lambda${\textgreater}1$\backslash$lambda{\textgreater}1 very large regions of aligned edges appear. We substantiate this picture as follows. For $\lambda${\textless}1$\backslash$lambda{\textless}1 sufficiently small, we show that correlations between edges decay exponentially with distance (suitably defined), and also that the Glauber dynamics (a local Markov chain based on flipping edges) is rapidly mixing (in time polynomial in the number of edges in the triangulation). This dynamics has been proposed by several authors as an algorithm for generating random triangulations. By contrast, for $\lambda${\textgreater}1$\backslash$lambda{\textgreater}1 we show that the mixing time is exponential. These are apparently the first rigorous quantitative results on the structure and dynamics of random lattice triangulations.},

The limiting process can be viewed heuristically as a one-dimensional diffusion with an absolutely continuous speed measure and a discontinuous scale function, as given by a two-sided stable subordinator. Corresponding to intervals of low conductance in the discrete model, the discontinuities in the scale function act as barriers off which the limiting process reflects for some time before crossing. We also discuss how, by incorporating a Bouchaud trap model element into the setting, it is possible to combine this 'blocking' mechanism with one of 'trapping'. Our proof relies on a recently developed theory that relates the convergence of processes to that of associated resistance metric measure spaces.},

abstract = {We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk (G{\"{a}}rtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005) and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mah{\'{e}} et al., 2004) graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n 2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of Fr{\"{o}}hlich et al.

We demonstrate important scenarios where a model with a finite and deterministic number of streets, termed binomial line process, is more accurate. We characterize the statistical properties of the BLP and the corresponding binomial line Cox process and apply them to analyze the performance of a network whose access points are deployed along the streets of a city. Such a deployment scenario will be typical for 5G and future wireless networks. In order to obtain a fine-grained insight into the network performance, we derive the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference and noise ratio. Accordingly, we investigate the mean local delay in transmission and the density of successful transmission. These metrics, respectively, characterize the latency and coverage performance of the network and are key performance indicators of next-generation wireless systems.},

Under suitable assumptions on the point processes, we show that the random walk satisfies an almost sure (or quenched) invariance principle. This invariance principle holds for point processes which have clustering or repulsiveness properties including Poisson point processes, Mat{\{}$\backslash$'e{\}}rn cluster and Mat{\{}$\backslash$'e{\}}rn hardcore processes. The method relies on the decomposition of the process into a martingale part and a corrector which is proved to be negligible at the diffusive scale.},
annote = {From AMS MR:
The Delaunay triangulation of a point process $\xi$ is the dual graph of the associated Voronoi tiling. In this article, conditions on a simple, stationary, isotropic point process are given under which the variable speed random walk on the Delaunay triangulation—that is, the Markov chain that has a unit transition rate along each edge of the graph—satisfies a quenched invariance principle, i.e. for almost-realisation of the point process, the random walk converges to Brownian motion under the usual diffusive scaling (a similar result is also noted for the discrete-time simple random walk). More specifically, the conditions on the point process are as follows: (V) only small boxes not hit by $\xi$; (SD) stochastic domination of the collection of `good boxes', where the number of points in $\xi$ is well behaved, by a Bernoulli site percolation process; (Er) ergodicity of $\xi$ under translations; and (PM) polynomial moments for certain quantities, such as the number of points of $\xi$ in a unit volume. Alternative conditions are also provided, and it is also noted that they are readily checked for homogeneous Poisson processes, Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster processes, and Mat{\'{e}}rn hardcore processes. The proof is based on the now standard approach for proving quenched invariance principles involving the construction of a (sub-linear) harmonic corrector, which enables the result to be obtained from a classical invariance principle for martingales.

Many studies concentrate on the percolation threshold and the characterization of the conduction in such materials. Nevertheless, no theoretical study has yet attempted to characterize the CNT features inside finite size CNT networks. We present a theoretical approach based on geometrical and statistical considerations. We demonstrate the possibility of explicitly determining some relations existing between two neighbor CNTs and their contact efficiency in random networks of identical CNTs. We calculate the contact probability of rigid identical CNTs and we obtain a probability of 0.2027, which turns out to be independent of the CNT density. Based on this probability, we establish also the dependence of the number of contacts per CNT as a function of the CNT density. All the theoretical results are validated by very good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We explore polygonal Markov fields techniques developed by Arak-Surgailis. The discrete version is presented first and a natural continuum generalization to a continuous object living on the discrete lattice is then proposed and studied. The broken lines also resemble the Young diagram and the Hammersley process and are useful for computing last passage percolation values and finding maximal oriented paths. For a class of passage time distributions there is a family of boundary conditions that make the process stationary and self-dual. For such distributions there is a law of large numbers and the process extends to the infinite lattice. A proof of Burke's theorem emerges from the construction. We present a simple proof of the explicit law of large numbers for last passage percolation as an application. Finally we show that the exponential and geometric distributions are the only non-trivial ones that yield self-duality.},

abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental property of complex networks and it is the mathematical expression of a ubiquitous phenomenon that arises in various types of self-organized networks such as biological networks, computer networks, or social networks. In this article, we consider what is called the global clustering coefficient of random graphs on the hyperbolic plane. This model of random graphs was proposed recently by Krioukov and colleagues as a mathematical model of complex networks, under the fundamental assumption that hyperbolic geometry underlies the structure of these networks. We give a rigorous analysis of clustering and characterize the global clustering coefficient in terms of the parameters of the model. We show how the global clustering coefficient can be tuned by these parameters and we give an explicit formula for this function.},

In order to fill this gap, the fractional Weibull process (fWp) is defined in this paper with the realization algorithm. The self-similarity property as well as long range dependence (LRD) are proven for the future research. The simulation is conducted by the actual data. The fWd is utilized to fit the actual probability distribution and the corresponding process is generated to reflect the stochasticity of the data.

of nineteenth-century mathematics, originated by Abel, Gauss,
Jacobi, and Legendre. This 1997 book presents an introductory
account of the subject in the style of the original discoverers,
with references to and comments about more recent and modern
developments. It combines three of the fundamental themes of
mathematics: complex function theory, geometry, and arithmetic.
After an informal preparatory chapter, the book follows an
historical path, beginning with the work of Abel and Gauss on
elliptic integrals and elliptic functions. This is followed by
chapters on theta functions, modular groups and modular functions,
the quintic, the imaginary quadratic field, and on elliptic
curves. Requiring only a first acquaintance with complex function
theory, this book is an ideal introduction to the subject for
graduate students and researchers in mathematics and physics, with
many exercises with hints scattered throughout the text.},

abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

Some quite general conditions are given, under which it is shown that the model is well defined and exhibits no percolation. The absence of percolation is attributable to the fact that, under our assumptions, there can be no descending chains in N. The proof of this fact forms a significant part of the paper. It is also shown that, in the absence of descending chains, mutual-nearest-neighbour matching can be used to construct a bijective point map as defined by Thorisson. {\textcopyright} Applied Probability Trust 2005.},

abstract = {Consider the following random spatial network: in a large disk, construct a network using a stationary and isotropic Poisson line process of unit intensity. Connect pairs of points using the network, with initial/final segments of the connecting path formed by travelling off the network in the opposite direction to that of the destination/source. Suppose further that connections are established using ‘near geodesics', constructed between pairs of points using the perimeter of the cell containing these two points and formed using only the Poisson lines not separating them. If each pair of points generates an infinitesimal amount of traffic divided equally between the two connecting near geodesics, and if the Poisson line pattern is conditioned to contain a line through the centre, then what can be said about the total flow through the centre? In Kendall (2011) it was shown that a scaled version of this flow has asymptotic distribution given by the 4-volume of a region in 4-space, constructed using an improper anisotropic Poisson line process in an infinite planar strip. Here we construct a more amenable representation in terms of two ‘seminal curves' defined by the improper Poisson line process, and establish results which produce a framework for effective simulation from this distribution up to an L 1 error which tends to 0 with increasing computational effort.},

abstract = {We introduce the notions of tree-like path and tree-like equivalence between paths and prove that the latter is an equivalence relation for paths of finite length. We show that the equivalence classes form a group with some similarity to a free group, and that in each class there is one special tree reduced path. The set of these paths is the Reduced Path Group. It is a continuous analogue to the group of reduced words. The signature of the path is a power series whose coefficients are definite iterated integrals of the path. We identify the paths with trivial signature as the tree-like paths, and prove that two paths are in tree-like equivalence if and only if they have the same signature. In this way, we extend Chen's theorems on the uniqueness of the sequence of iterated integrals associated with a piecewise regular path to finite length paths and identify the appropriate extended meaning for reparameterisation in the general setting. It is suggestive to think of this result as a non-commutative analogue of the result that integrable functions on the circle are determined, up to Lebesgue null sets, by their Fourier coefficients. As a second theme we give quantitative versions of Chen's theorem in the case of lattice paths and paths with continuous derivative, and as a corollary derive results on the triviality of exponential products in the tensor algebra.},

CLT is related to the family of Travelling Salesman Problems with Profits, but differs by defining the weight function on edges instead of vertices, and by requiring the total weight to be within a range instead of being at least some quota. We prove CLT is {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}NP{\}}{\$}-hard, even in the simple case when the input graph is a path. We derive an informative lower bound by relaxing the integrality of edges and propose a heuristic motivated by this relaxation. For the case that requires the tour to be a simple cycle, we develop two heuristics which exploit Suurballe's algorithm to find low-cost, weight-feasible cycles. We demonstrate our algorithms by addressing a real-world problem that affects urban populations: finding routes that minimise air pollution exposure for walking, running and cycling in the city of London.},

abstract = {In this article we explore how structural parameters of composites filled with one-dimensional, electrically conducting elements (such as sticks, needles, chains, or rods) affect the percolation properties of the system. To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of asymmetric two-dimensional stick systems with anisotropic alignments. We compute the percolation probability functions in the direction of preferential orientation of the percolating objects and in the orthogonal direction, as functions of the experimental structural parameters. Among these, we considered the average length of the sticks, the standard deviation of the length distribution, and the standard deviation of the angular distribution. We developed a computer algorithm capable of reproducing and verifying known theoretical results for isotropic networks and which allows us to go beyond and study anisotropic systems of experimental interest. Our research shows that the total electrical anisotropy, considered as a direct consequence of the percolation anisotropy, depends mainly on the standard deviation of the angular distribution and on the average length of the sticks. A conclusion of practical interest is that we find that there is a wide and well-defined range of values for the mentioned parameters for which it is possible to obtain reliable anisotropic percolation under relatively accessible experimental conditions when considering composites formed by dispersions of sticks, oriented in elastomeric matrices.},

abstract = {Cities need to build on their resilience to deal with the combined effects of urbanization, changing geopolitical contexts, and climate change. The physical form of cities has significant implications for their capacity to deal with adverse events and changing conditions. This paper focuses on streets as major constituent elements of urban form. It offers a review of the theoretical discussions and empirical evidence on how design and con- figuration of urban streets and street networks can contribute to/detract from urban resilience. For the purpose of this study, measures related to urban streets are divided into two broad categories: network topology and design and orientation. Network topology is used to represent urban street network as a combination of nodes and links. Relationships between urban resilience and different centrality and connectivity measures related to network topology are discussed. The design and orientation category explores the possible effects of street width, street edges, street canyon geometry, and street layout and orientation on resilience of cities. It is discussed that all topology and design measures have implications for urban resilience. Appropriate physical form of urban streets can contribute to urban resilience by, among other things, ameliorating urban microclimate, reducing energy consumption and its associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing social capital, improving community health and well-being, and facilitating rapid and effective emergency response in the aftermath of disasters. Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streets and street networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for obtaining heavy-traffic limits for infinite-server queues and open networks of infinite-server queues. The key observation is that infinite-server queues having deterministic service times can easily be analyzed in terms of the arrival counting process. A variant of the same idea applies when the service times take values in a finite set, so this is the key assumption. In addition to new proofs of established results, the paper contains several new results, including limits for the work-in-system process, limits for steady-state distributions, limits for open networks with general customer routes, and rates of convergence. The relatively tractable Gaussian limits are promising approximations for many-server queues and open networks of such queues, possibly with finite waiting rooms.},

abstract = {For independent translation-invariant irreducible percolation models, it is proved that the infinite cluster, when it exists, must be unique. The proof is based on the convexity (or almost convexity) and differentiability of the mean number of clusters per site, which is the percolation analogue of the free energy. The analysis applies to both site and bond models in arbitrary dimension, including long range bond percolation. In particular, uniqueness is valid at the critical point of one-dimensional 1/∣x−y∣2 models in spite of the discontinuity of the percolation density there. Corollaries of uniqueness and its proof are continuity of the connectivity functions and (except possibly at the critical point) of the percolation density. Related to differentiability of the free energy are inequalities which bound the “specific heat” critical exponent $\alpha$ in terms of the mean cluster size exponent $\gamma$ and the critical cluster size distribution exponent $\delta$; e.g., 1+$\alpha$≦$\gamma$ ($\delta$/2−1)/($\delta$−1).},

The problem solved here is the continuous version of an optimization problem on how to design efficient allocation algorithms for massively parallel supercomputers. In the language of continuum mechanics, the shape of the optimal city is that taken by a blob of incompressible fluid composed of molecules whose pairwise interactions are described by an attractive potential proportional to the Manhattan distance between the particles.},

This new network model also accounts for the complex interaction of protofibrils with each other, effect of presence of solvent, Coulombic attraction and other binding forces. The network model is applied to simulate the force extension behavior of single fibrin fiber from atomic force microscopy experiments and shows good agreement. Thus validated fibrin fiber network model is then combined with a modified version of Arruda-Boyce eight chain model to estimate the force extension behavior of continuum level fibrin clot, which shows very good correlation. The results show that this network model is able to predict the behavior of fibrin fibers as well as fibrin clot at small strains, large strains and even closer to the break strain. We use the network model to explain why the fibrin clots and fibers doesn't behave like a worm like chain, instead behaves like a nonlinear spring.},

From AMS MR:
Let I be a countably infinite set of points in R which can be written as I={\{}ui: i∈Z{\}}, with ui{\textless}ui+1 for every i, where ui→±∞ as i→±∞. Consider a continuous-time Markov chain Y={\{}Y(t): t≥0{\}} with state space I such that Y is driftless and Y jumps only between nearest neighbours. The convergence property of the Markov chain Y on the set I under suitable space-time scalings is investigated in this paper. A basic conclusion obtained is as follows. Let Y$\theta$(t):=$\theta$−1Y($\theta$2t) ($\theta${\textgreater}0) be the scaled version of the Markov chain Y and let $\mu$$\theta$ be the measure on R which assigns a mass mi/$\theta$ to the point ui/$\theta$, where mi=(ui+1−ui−1)/(2∑j≠iqij(uj−ui)2), with qij the (i,j) element of the Q-matrix of Y. If $\mu$$\theta$ converges to the Lebesgue measure, then the law of Y$\theta$ converges weakly to the law of standard Brownian motion. In the latter part of the paper the authors wisely apply this conclusion to some cases when the set I consists of the points of a renewal process and the jump rates assigned to each state in I are perhaps randomly chosen, and some further interesting results are thus obtained.

abstract = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the size of smart grid are witnessing rapid expansion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.},

A key ingredient when analysing the connectivity phase transition is to consider a restriction of the full process onto a subspace.

Mikosch review: "{\{}About the first edition: To sum it up, one can perhaps see a distinction among advanced probability books into those which are original and path-breaking in content, such as Levy's and Doob's well-known examples, and those which aim primarily to assimilate known material, such as Loeve's and more recently Rogers and Williams'. Seen in this light, Kallenberg's present book would have to qualify as the assimilation of probability par excellence. It is a great edifice of material, clearly and ingeniously presented, without any non-mathematical distractions. Readers wishing to venture into it may do so with confidence that they are in very capable hands. - Mathematical Reviews This new edition contains four new chapters as well as numerous improvements throughout the text. There are new chapters on measure Theory-key results, ergodic properties of Markov processes and large deviations.{\}}"},

In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

abstract = {A wide variety of methods have been used to compute percolation thresholds. In lattice percolation, the most powerful of these methods consists of microcanonical simulations using the union-find algorithm to efficiently determine the connected clusters, and (in two dimensions) using exact values from conformal field theory for the probability, at the phase transition, that various kinds of wrapping clusters exist on the torus. We apply this approach to percolation in continuum models, finding overlaps between objects with real-valued positions and orientations. In particular, we find precise values of the percolation transition for disks, squares, rotated squares, and rotated sticks in two dimensions and confirm that these transitions behave as conformal field theory predicts. The running time and memory use of our algorithm are essentially linear as a function of the number of objects at criticality. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This paper reports a study of scale-invariant Rayleigh Random Flights ("RRF'') in random environments given by planar Scale-Invariant Random Spatial Networks ("SIRS") based on speed-marked Poisson line processes. RRF can be viewed as producing "randomly broken {\$}\Pi{\$}-geodesics" on the SIRSN; the aim of the study is to shed some light on whether a (non-broken) {\$}\Pi{\$}-geodesic on a SIRSN might ever come to a complete stop en route. Suitable RRF with scale-invariant dynamics ("SIRSN-RRF"), are introduced via a theory of abstract scattering representations for Markov chains (which should be of independent interest). Palm conditioning (specifically the Mecke-Slivnyak theorem for Palm probabilities of Poisson point processes) and ideas from the ergodic theory of random walks in random environments are used to show that there exists a natural scale-invariant SIRSN-RRF whose speed neither diverges to infinity nor tends to zero.

The author continues his study of scale-invariant random spatial networks (SIRSNs), as introduced by D. J. Aldous and K. Ganesan [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110 (2013), no. 22, 8782–8785; MR3082274] and Aldous [Electron. J. Probab. 19 (2014), no. 15; MR3164768]. The particular model of interest is built from a marked Poisson line process on the plane R2 with intensity measure given by 
$\nu$(dvdrd$\theta$)=$\gamma$−12v−$\gamma$dvdrd$\theta$,
where r∈R is the signed distance of a line from the origin, $\theta$∈[0,$\pi$) is the angle made by the line and the x-axis, v∈(0,∞) is a `speed-limit' for the line, and $\gamma${\textgreater}2 is a parameter. (Although not corresponding to a SIRSN, the borderline case $\gamma$=2 is also considered within the article.) 
   The focus of the present work is to define and explore basic properties of a natural, scale-invariant Rayleigh random flight (RRF) that has such a SIRSN as its state space. Roughly speaking, the process constructed starts by following a line in some direction at its maximum velocity, v say. On meeting a line of speed v′, it will switch to this with probability min{\{}1,(v′/v)$\alpha${\}}, where $\alpha$∈($\gamma$−1,∞) is a parameter. That is, the process will always switch to a faster line, but to a slower line with a probability depending on how its speed relates to the current speed. On transferring to a new line, a direction is chosen uniformly at random. (NB: Taking $\alpha$ within the given range ensures a certain non-degeneracy of the process.) Following the rigorous introduction of the SIRSN-RRF, a stationary measure is found for the relative environment seen from the process at times when it changes lines. To quote from the introduction of the article, this consists of `the independent superposition of a unit-speed line along the x-axis with a line through [the origin] of 
(a)
a random log-speed given by a possibly asymmetric Laplace density; 
(b)
and a random angle ϕ with the unit-speed line (with ϕ having sine-weighted density); 
(c)
together with a copy of [the SIRSN].' 

   By checking that, when started from this stationary measure, the relative-environment process is ergodic, the author concludes that the SIRSN-RRF is `speed-neighbourhood-recurrent' at the critical value $\alpha$=2($\gamma$−1) (which is the unique value for which the measure described in part (a) above is symmetric). He describes the latter result as the main contribution of the paper and asserts that it is evidence in favour of the conjecture for planar SIRSNs that geodesics between two points never come to a complete halt (away from the endpoints). To complete the article, various interesting questions that point to directions for future research on the model are raised. Reviewed by David A. Croydon},

This random graph is studied through a novel subgraph, called a bridge graph, generated by paths started in a fixed state at any time. The bridge graph is made into a unimodular network by marking it and selecting a root in a specified fashion. The unimodularity of this network is leveraged to discern global properties of the larger Doeblin graph. Bi-recurrence, i.e., recurrence both forwards and backwards in time, is introduced and shown to be a key property in uniquely distinguishing paths in the Doeblin graph, and also a decisive property for Markov chains indexed by Z. Properties related to simulating the bridge graph are also studied.},

Once cities are physically organized in terms of infrastructure, people interact with each other to form the values, which can be regarded as the meta- information of the cities. The topology and meta-information coevolve together as the cities are developed. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the topology and meta-information for a street network, which has aspects of both a complex network and planar graph. The degree of organization of a street structure determines the efficiency and productivity of the city in that they act as blood vessels to transport people, goods, and information. We analyze the topological aspect of a street network using centrali- ties including the betweenness, closeness, straightness, and information. We classify the cities into several groups that share common meta-information based on the centrality, indicating that the topological factor of the street structure is closely related to meta- information through coevolution. We also obtain the coevolution in the planned cities using the regularity. Another footprint is the relation between the street segment length and the population, which shows the sublinear scaling.},

On a qualitative level, intermittent random fields are distinguished by the appearance of sparsely distributed sharp "peaks" which give the main contribution to the formation of the statistical moments. The paper deals with the Cauchy problem (∂/∂t)u(t, x)=Hu(t, x), u(0, x)=t0(x) ≥ 0, (t, x) ∈ ℝ+ × ℤd, for the Anderson Hamiltonian H = $\kappa$$\Delta$ + $\xi$({\textperiodcentered}), $\xi$(x), x ∈ ℤd where is a (generally unbounded) spatially homogeneous random potential. This first part is devoted to some basic problems. Using percolation arguments, a complete answer to the question of existence and uniqueness for the Cauchy problem in the class of all nonnegative solutions is given in the case of i.i.d. random variables. Necessary and sufficient conditions for intermittency of the fields u(t,{\textperiodcentered}) as t→∞ are found in spectral terms of H. Rough asymptotic formulas for the statistical moments and the almost sure behavior of u(t,x) as t→∞ are also derived. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

Key properties of the graphs in this context turn out to be amenability and nonamenability. The same problem is considered for certain dependent percolation models – most prominently the Fortuin–Kasteleyn random-cluster model – and in situations where the standard connectivity notion is replaced by entanglement or rigidity. So-called simultaneous uniqueness in couplings of percolation processes is also considered. Some of the main results are proved in detail, while for others the proofs are merely sketched, and for yet others they are omitted. Several open problems are discussed.},

First, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial sub- and super-critical percolation regimes based on the notion of stabilization. Second, we give asymptotic expressions for the percolation probability in large-radius, high-density and coupled regimes. In some regimes, we find universality, whereas in others, a sensitive dependence on the underlying random intensity measure survives.},

abstract = {{\{}Statistical network modeling has focused on representing the graph as a discrete structure, namely the adjacency matrix, and considering the exchangeability of this array. In such cases, the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem (Aldous, 1981;Hoover, 1979{\}} applies and informs us that the graph is necessarily either dense or empty. In this paper, we instead consider representing the graph as a measure on {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\_}+{\^{}}2{\$}. For the associated definition of exchangeability in this continuous space, we rely on the Kallenberg representation theorem (Kallenberg, 2005). We show that for certain choices of such exchangeable random measures underlying our graph construction, our network process is sparse with power-law degree distribution. In particular, we build on the framework of completely random measures (CRMs) and use the theory associated with such processes to derive important network properties, such as an urn representation for our analysis and network simulation. Our theoretical results are explored empirically and compared to common network models. We then present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution and demonstrate that we are able to recover graphs ranging from dense to sparse---and perform associated tests---based on our flexible CRM-based formulation. We explore network properties in a range of real datasets, including Facebook social circles, a political blogosphere, protein networks, citation networks, and world wide web networks, including networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges.},

By analogy with the geometric models, and with the discrete coupon collector's problem and with cover times for finite Markov chains, one expects a "weak concentration" bound for the distribution of the cover time to hold under minimal assumptions. We give two such results, one for random fixed-radius balls and the other for sequentially arriving randomly-centered and deterministically growing balls. Each is in fact a simple application of a different more general bound, the former concerning coverage by i.i.d. random sets with arbitrary distribution, and the latter concerning hitting times for Markov chains with a strong monotonicity property. The growth model seems generally more tractable, and we record some basic results and open problems for that model.},

The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classification, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classification.},

Degree, betweenness, and PageRank centralities are selected as the analysis measures, and GPS-enabled taxi trajectory data is used to evaluate urban traffic flow. The results show that the mean value of the correlation coefficients between the modified degree, the betweenness, and the PageRank centralities and the traffic flow in all periods are higher than the mean value of the correlation coefficients between the conventional degree, the betweenness, the PageRank centralities and the traffic flow at different modes; this indicates that the modified measurements, for analyzing traffic flow, are superior to conventional centrality measurements. This study helps to shed light into the understanding of urban traffic flow in relation to different modes from the perspective of complex networks.},

abstract = {With smart grids replacing conventional power grids and rapidly expanding in both space and time, ensuring an acceptable system observability becomes a challenge in spatio-temporal expanding power grids. In addition, system operators face another challenge, namely, financial budget constraints. To address these challenges, a metering equipment allocation strategy for monitoring of the power grid state needs to be dynamic in both space and time. Unfortunately, existing metering allocation strategies are quite limited. They usually deal with static power grid topologies, and hence, do not reflect the spatio-temporal expansion of the power grid. In this paper, a spatio-temporal power grid model is proposed based on stochastic geometry, which we show that it is in a good match with real-world power grids. The proposed model enables us to carry out tractable dynamic allocation of metering equipment in a large (city-wide) and structurally evolving power grid. Using the developed model, a multi-year algorithm for the allocation of metering equipment is proposed based on finite horizon dynamic programming, given budgetary and technical constraints on system observability. Several case studies for metering allocation are demonstrated through simulation results.},

According to this discipline, systems of economic and spatial interaction are considered as spatial networks and are modeled into graphs. This approach allows studying transportation networks and other spatial networks of national and global economic importance in terms of graph theory and statistical mechanics and it can provide new insights for the structure and functionality of these systems, which are not visible through the prism of spatial and economic analysis. Within this context, this paper models the interregional road transportation network in Greece (GRN), a spatial network of prime economic importance for its country, into a geo-referenced primal graph and it discusses its geographical and topological features under the regional economics' perspec­ tive. The results show that GRN has a mesh (lattice-like) structure subjected to spatial constraints and that it is ruled by primary developmental dynamics, where many aspects of network topology are related to economic aspects of the road network. Overall, the paper highlights that measures of network topology are related to different aspects of the network's socio-economic framework and thus they can be considered as indicators of economic performance for this transportation network.},

abstract = {It is well-known in biology that ants are able to find shortest paths between their nest and the food by successive random explorations, without any mean of communication other than the pheromones they leave behind them. This striking phenomenon has been observed experimentally and modelled by different mean-field reinforcement-learning models in the biology literature. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic reinforcement-learning model for this phenomenon. In this model, the ants explore a finite graph in which two nodes are distinguished as the nest and the source of food. The ants perform successive random walks on this graph, starting from the nest and stopped when first reaching the food, and the transition probabilities of each random walk depend on the realizations of all previous walks through some dynamic weighting of the graph. We discuss different variants of this model based on different reinforcement rules and show that slight changes in this reinforcement rule can lead to drastically different outcomes. We prove that, in two variants of this model and when the underlying graph is, respectively, any series-parallel graph and a 5-edge non-series-parallel losange graph, the ants indeed eventually find the shortest path(s) between their nest and the food. Both proofs rely on the electrical network method for random walks on weighted graphs and on Rubin's embedding in continuous time. The proof in the series-parallel cases uses the recursive nature of this family of graphs, while the proof in the seemingly-simpler losange case turns out to be quite intricate: it relies on a fine analysis of some stochastic approximation, and on various couplings with standard and generalised P$\backslash$'olya urns.},

abstract = {Random planar tessellations are presented which are generated by subsequent division of their polygonal cells. The purpose is to develop parametric models for crack patterns appearing at length scales which can change by orders of magnitude in areas such as nanotechnology, materials science, soft matter, and geology. Using the STIT tessellation as a reference model and comparing with phenomena in real crack patterns, three modifications of STIT are suggested. For all these models a simulation tool, which also yields several statistics for the tessellation cells, is provided on the web. The software is freely available via a link given in the bibliography of this article. The present paper contains results of a simulation study indicating some essential features of the models. Finally, an example of a real fracture pattern is considered which is obtained using the deposition of a thin metallic film onto an elastomer material – the results of this are compared to the predictions of the model.},

abstract = {Maximal couplings are (probabilistic) couplings of Markov processes such that the tail probabilities of the coupling time attain the total variation lower bound (Aldous bound) uniformly for all time. Markovian (or immersion) couplings are couplings defined by strategies where neither process is allowed to look into the future of the other before making the next transition. Markovian couplings are typically easier to construct and analyze than general couplings, and play an important role in many branches of probability and analysis. Hsu and Sturm (2013) proved that the reflection-coupling of Brownian motion is the unique Markovian maximal coupling (MMC) of Brownian motions starting from two different points. Later, Kuwada (2009) proved that the existence of a MMC for Brownian motions on a Riemannian manifold enforces existence of a reflection structure on the manifold. In this work, we investigate suitably regular elliptic diffusions on manifolds, and show how consideration of the diffusion geometry (including dimension of the isometry group and flows of isometries) is fundamental in classification of the space and the generator of the diffusion for which an MMC exists, especially when the MMC also holds under local perturbations of the starting points for the coupled diffusions. We also describe such diffusions in terms of Killing vectorfields (generators of isometry groups) and dilation vectorfields (generators of scaling symmetry groups).},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
The authors study the Markovian maximal couplings of elliptic diffusion processes on manifolds and show that the existence of such a coupling implies strong conditions on the space and the generator of the process. The paper begins with an introduction and some history on the subject. A coupling of two processes on the same state space, starting at two different points, is a joint distribution such that with a nonzero probability, the two processes will meet and then stick together. The Aldous inequality states: 
P($\tau${\textgreater}t)≥∥$\mu$1,t−$\mu$2,t∥TV,
that is, the tail probability of the coupling time $\tau$ is bounded below by the total variation norm of the difference between the distributions of the two processes at time t. The coupling is called maximal if the equality is attained for all t{\textgreater}0. A coupling of two Markov processes is called Markovian if the joint process is also Markovian. An interesting example of a Markovian maximal coupling (MMC) is the reflection coupling of two copies of Brownian motion in a Euclidean space, in which the second process is obtained by reflecting the first one on the hyperplane bisecting the two initial points until it reaches the hyperplane. It was shown in [E. P. Hsu and K.-T. Sturm, Commun. Math. Stat. 1 (2013), no. 1, 93–104; MR3197874] that the reflection coupling is the unique MMC for Euclidean Brownian motion. The MMC of Brownian motions on Riemannian manifolds, in connection with reflection, was investigated in [K. Kuwada, Electron. J. Probab. 14 (2009), no. 25, 633–662; MR2486817]. 
   The aim of the present paper is to develop the results in [K. Kuwada, op. cit.] to the case of a general elliptic diffusion process on a manifold M with smooth coefficients, under certain regularity conditions. Such a diffusion process may be regarded as a Brownian motion plus a drift under a suitable Riemannian structure on M. It is shown that the existence of the MMC for any two initial points near two fixed points imposes some rather strong conditions on the space M and the drift term. More precisely, M has to be one of three basic space forms: a Euclidean space, a hypersphere or a hyperbolic space. Moreover, the drift can only be an infinitesimal isometry (and a dilation in the Euclidean case). The time-dependent drifts are also considered on Euclidean spaces. Reviewed by Ming Liao},

abstract = {We consider sequences (XtN)t≥0 of Markov processes in two dimensions whose fluid limit is a stable solution of an ordinary differential equation of the form it =b(xt), where b(x) = (0 $\lambda$-$\mu$ 0)x + $\tau$(x) for some $\lambda$, $\mu$ {\textgreater} 0 and $\tau$(x) = O(|x|2). Here the processes are indexed so that the variance of the fluctuations of XtN is inversely proportional to N. The simplest example arises from the OK Corral gunfight model which was formulated by Williams and McIlroy [Bull. London Math. Soc. 30 (1998) 166-170] and studied by Kingman [Bull. London Math. Soc. 31 (1999) 601-606], These processes exhibit their most interesting behavior at times of order log N so it is necessary to establish a fluid limit that is valid for large times. We find that this limit is inherently random and obtain its distribution. Using this, it is possible to derive scaling limits for the points where these processes hit straight lines through the origin, and the minimum distance from the origin that they can attain. The power of N that gives the appropriate scaling is surprising. For example if T is the time that XtN first hits one of the lines y = x or y = -x, then N $\mu$/(2($\lambda$+$\mu$))|XTN| ⇒ |Z| $\mu$/($\lambda$+$\mu$)for some zero mean Gaussian random variable Z. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2007.},

We show how to prove the non-nullness for a large number of cases, and also give an alternate version of the last condition such that the non-nullness requirement can be dropped.

The line process can be characterized by its intensity measure, which belongs to a one-parameter family if scale and Euclidean invariance are required. This paper investigates a proposal by Aldous, namely that the line process could be used to produce a scale-invariant random spatial network (SIRSN) by means of connecting up points using paths which follow segments from the line process at the stipulated speeds. It is shown that this does indeed produce a scaleinvariant network, under suitable conditions on the parameter; in fact, it then produces a parameter-dependent random geodesic metric for d-dimensional space (d ≥ 2), where geodesics are given by minimum-time paths. Moreover, in the planar case, it is shown that the resulting geodesic metric space has an almost everywhere unique-geodesic property that geodesics are locally of finite mean length, and that if an independent Poisson point process is connected up by such geodesics then the resulting network places finite length in each compact region. It is an open question whether the result is a SIRSN (in Aldous' sense; so placing finite mean length in each compact region), but it may be called a pre-SIRSN.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
The emergence of very large-scale spatial networks, such as those used by Google Maps and Bing Maps, has prompted the development of mathematical models possessing various natural statistical invariances under translation, rotation, and scaling. The core structure of scale-invariant random spatial networks (SIRSN) was elicited in a definition by David Aldous (2014), together with a proposal for a stochastic geometric construction via Poisson line processes. In the paper under review, the author effectively exploits a point-line duality analysis of this construction and verifies that it satisfies the first four of six conditions for an SIRSN in two dimensions, referred to as a pre-SIRSN. In higher dimensions the first two conditions, namely those for a random metric space, are verified. The questions in two dimensions pertaining to an additional fifth property defining a weak SIRSN, and the fifth and sixth defining a full SIRSN, are left open. The paper is concluded with basic open questions, together with some intriguing connections to Brownian maps and, perhaps, Liouville Brownian motions. Reviewed by Edward C. Waymire},

This book extends an earlier paper by the author [Advances in Appl. Probability 4 (1972), 508–541; MR0348819]. Topologies are constructed on the spaces of closed, open or compact subsets of a locally compact separable Hausdorff space which enable the assignment of probabilities to events such as the hitting or avoidance of a random set by a "structuring'' set. The concept of a random set presented is less general than the treatment of D. G. Kendall [Stochastic geometry (a tribute to the memory of Rollo Davidson), pp. 322–376, Wiley, London, 1974]. Alternating Choquet capacities of infinite order are shown to bear a relationship to random closed sets analogous to that between distribution functions and (real-valued) random variables. 
   Covariance functions, continuity in probability, weak stationarity and the existence of fixed points are discussed—these being concerned with the stochastic process determined by the indicator function of a random set. Concepts of almost sure continuity, infinite divisibility, stability and semi-Markovian property, similar in some respects to their counterparts in other areas of probability theory, are developed in a way which shows the increased scope of random set theory over a stochastic process viewpoint. 
   The fourth chapter provides a useful English reference for integral geometry, presenting some of the basic material from H. Hadwiger [Vorlesungen {\"{u}}ber Inhalt, Oberfl{\"{a}}che und Isoperimetrie, Chapter 6, Springer, Berlin, 1957; MR0102775; Russian translation, Izdat. "Nauka'', Moscow, 1966; MR0206822]. However, the chapter is not self-contained, there being frequent interplay between geometrical notions and the preceding random set theory. Almost sure convexity, tangential cones at the origin of covariance functions in Rd, random intercepts and projections are discussed in this section. 
   An alternative extension of the Minkowski functionals to finite unions of compact convex sets, based on a generalised Steiner formula, is presented for the first time in this book, unfortunately, in an ill-defined form. {\{}The application of (4–7–1) to obtain (4–7–7) is incorrect. However, the author has demonstrated (private communication) the existence of measures WkK which satisfy the first part of (4–7–7), namely 
∫(∑x′∈∏K(x,r)ϕ(x′))dx=∑k=0d(dk)rk∫WkK(dx)ϕ(x).
The proof proceeds by first considering a finite union K of compact convex sets Kk all of which are open with respect to a ball of radius $\epsilon$. A function $\Phi$i1,⋯,ik, equal almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue measure to Fi1,⋯,ik, but whose value at x depends only upon ∏Ki1∩⋯∩Kik(x) is then defined. Upon replacing F by $\Phi$, and noting that (4–7–1) is valid for integrable ϕ, (4–7–7) may be obtained. An approximation argument is invoked to deal with the general case.{\}} (The classical extension to the Minkowski functionals is obtained by extending additivity properties, and the author mentions yet another extension obtained by considering mean projections.) The Steiner-type extension is applied later to convexity number and densities of Minkowski functionals for random sets. 
   The main examples of random sets given are stationary, semi-Markov, infinitely divisible random closed sets which are characterised as unions of Poisson distributed cylinders with compact convex bases. Poisson networks of linear varieties are treated in detail, many results being due to R. E. Miles and others new. 
   An axiomatic approach brings the hazy experimental notions of grain size into mathematical perspective. Results applicable to the estimation of linear granulometries from experimental data are given. Motivated by these ideas, the chapters near the end of the book deal with various properties of set-valued maps. The final chapter shows that set-valued integrals and measures may be developed in analogy with their real-valued counterparts, making use of the simple properties of Minkowski set operations. No probabilistic interpretation is given. 
   The main achievement of the book is the presentation of a rigorous framework upon which to develop geometrical probability. Familiarity with basic topology and probability theory is assumed of the reader, but results from integral geometry are either derived or stated with references. Reviewed by Pamela Davy},

The average stretch factor of G is the average stretch factor taken over all pairs of vertices in G. We show that, for any constant dimension d and any set V of n points in ℝd, there exists a geometric graph with vertex set V that has O(n) edges and that has average stretch factor 1 + on(1). More precisely, the average stretch factor of this graph is 1 + O((log n/n)1/(2d+1)). We complement this upper bound with a lower bound: There exist n-point sets in ℝ2 for which any graph with O(n) edges has average stretch factor 1 + $\Omega$ (1/√n). Bounds of this type are not possible for the more commonly studied worst-case stretch factor. In particular, there exist point sets V such that any graph with worst-case stretch factor 1 {\_} on(1) has a superlinear number of edges.},

Mecke, Stochastic geometry and its applications, Wiley Ser. Probab. Math. Statist., Wiley, Chichester, 1995; first edition, 1987; MR0895588; Math. Lehrb{\"{u}}cher Monogr. II. Abt. Math. Monogr., 69, Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1987; MR0879119]. As the authors write in the preface, this edition has to be considered as a "modernization'' of the previous one. Indeed, stochastic geometry finds application in many research fields (among them: materials sciences, biology, medicine, environmental sciences) in which new ideas, results and methods have been developed in the last two decades. More than 700 new references are listed in the bibliography in this new edition. 
   This book will certainly be useful both to the expert and to the beginner in stochastic geometry and spatial statistics looking for a reference text on the subject. The reader interested in learning more about both mathematical proofs and further applications of the results which are only cited or mentioned will find accurate references here. 
   As in the previous editions, the authors succeed in bringing together both the mathematical foundations necessary for a rigorous exposition of the subjects treated, and their statistical or computational aspects. The exposition is such that the reader is led from the simple to the more complicated; this is evident also from the order chosen to present the contents. Indeed, after an introductory chapter on mathematical foundations, the authors first introduce the Poisson point process (Chapter 2) and the Boolean model (Chapter 3), which are the simplest and most studied point process and random closed set, respectively, and then they pass to the general theory (Chapters 4–7). An entire chapter (Chapter 8) is devoted to the study of systems of fibres and systems of surfaces randomly distributed on the plane or in space, while Chapter 9 deals with random tessellations and related topics. In both chapters the interest is focused on general results in the cases of stationarity or motion invariance. The last chapter is devoted to stereology, as part of the applications of stochastic geometry and spatial statistics. Reviewed by Elena Villa},

abstract = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the size of smart grid are witnessing rapid expansion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.},

Second, aside from these classical results, we discuss recent perspectives and directions including (1) the connection between Busemann functions and geodesics, (2) the proof of sublinear variance under 2+log moments of passage times and (3) the role of growth and competition models.

In this paper we show that: (1) Traffic counts are a function of dependant spatial, temporal and neighbourhood variables, (2) Large open-source data, such as school location and public transport hubs can, with appropriate GIS and machine learning, assist the prediction of traffic counts, (3) Real-time simulation can be scaled-up to large networks with the aid of machine learning and, (4) Such techniques can be employed in real-world tools. Validation of the proposed approach demonstrates an 88.2{\%} prediction accuracy on traffic counts across the UK.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

abstract = {In this paper, a prediction model for the tensile behaviour of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete is proposed. It is based on integrating force contributions of all fibres crossing the crack plane. Piecewise linear models for the force contributions depending on fibre orientation and embedded length are fitted to force–slip curves obtained in single-fibre pull-out tests. Fibre characteristics in the crack are analysed in a micro-computed tomography image of a concrete sample. For more general predictions, a stochastic fibre model with a one-parametric orientation distribution is introduced. Simple estimators for the orientation parameter are presented, which only require fibre orientations in the crack plane. Our prediction method is calibrated to fit experimental tensile curves.},

abstract = {This monograph presents a rigorous mathematical introduction to optimal transport as a variational problem, its use in modeling various phenomena, and its connections with partial differential equations. Its main goal is to provide the reader with the techniques necessary to understand the current research in optimal transport and the tools which are most useful for its applications. Full proofs are used to illustrate mathematical concepts and each chapter includes a section that discusses applications of optimal transport to various areas, such as economics, finance, potential games, image processing and fluid dynamics. Several topics are covered that have never been previously in books on this subject, such as the Knothe transport, the properties of functionals on measures, the Dacorogna-Moser flow, the formulation through minimal flows with prescribed divergence formulation, the case of the supremal cost, and the most classical numerical methods. Graduate students and researchers in both pure and applied mathematics interested in the problems and applications of optimal transport will find this to be an invaluable resource.

abstract = {This paper is centered on covariant dynamics on random graphs and random networks (marked graphs), which can be described as rules to navigate the vertices that are preserved by graph/network isomorphisms. Such dynamics are referred to as vertex-shifts here. Unimodular random networks can be heuristically described as networks seen from a vertex chosen uniformly at random, both in the finite and in infinite network cases. Some general ways of constructing unimodular random networks are reviewed together with instances of vertex-shifts. The main result of the paper is a classification of vertex-shifts on unimodular random networks. Each such vertex-shift partitions the vertices into a collection of connected components and foils, which correspond to the orbits and the stable manifold of the dynamics, respectively. The classification is based on the cardinality of the connected components and foils. It is shown that up to an event of zero probability, there are three types of foliations in a connected component: F/F (with finitely many finite foils), I/F (infinitely many finite foils), and I/I (infinitely many infinite foils). Distinctive properties of each type are also derived. An infinite connected component of the graph of a vertex-shift is a tree which, in the unimodular case, shares some similarities with a critical branching process. Such trees are referred to as Eternal Family Trees here. Construction techniques of such trees are also discussed. These lead to additional structural results on the graphs of vertex shifts in each case of the classification. The results are illustrated by concrete examples stemming from classical domains of probability theory: random graphs, branching processes and stationary point processes.},

It is also proved that under a strictly weaker condition than existence of finite variance, there exists a positive critical intensity for the formation of clumps whose size is infinite with positive probability. Therefore these two critical intensities need not be the same.

The dead leaves model, introduced by the Mathematical Morphology school, consists in the superposition of random closed sets, and enables to model the occlusion phenomena. When combined with specific sizes distributions for objects, they are known to provide adequate models for natural images. However this framework yields a small scales cutoff and a limit random field is introduced by letting this cutoff tend to zero. We first give a rigorous definition of the dead leaves model, and compute the probability that n compacts are included in distinct visible parts, which characterizes the model.

The map serves as a low-dimensional signature of the fracture network and is visually presented as a pair of three-dimensional graphs. A systematic study is made of a wide collection of real crack networks for various materials, collected from different sources. To identify the characteristics of the real materials, several well-known mathematical models of convex polygonal networks are presented and worked out. These geometric models may correspond to different physical fracturing processes. The proposed map is shown to be discriminative, and the points corresponding to materials of similar properties are found to form closely spaced groups in the parameter space.
