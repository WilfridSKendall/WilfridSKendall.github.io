#### 29 May 2024, Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen memorial conference (Aarhus, Denmark)

Short form (25 minutes) of [Wandering around a fibrous network (when all the paths look very much alike)](https://wilfridskendall.github.io/talks/Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk-2024/Short-Fibre-SIRSN-talk-handout.pdf).

**Abstract:** ... an overview of work I have been interested in for the last decade or so, concerned with generating models based on Poisson processes which supply insight into route-finding and traffic flows. Initial constructions (Aldous 2014, Kahn 2016, Kendall 2017) showed existence of such models satisfying the SIRSN axioms formulated by Aldous (2014). But these constructions all involve infinitely long linear paths, and in particular do not easily admit local influences. Can one do better? I shall discuss recent work showing that SIRSN can indeed arise under far less stringent conditions, based on line segments or even suitably stiff fibres.

#### 16 May 2024, Theo Cacoullos Memorial Lecture (Kozani, Greece)

Colloquium-style talk (45 minutes) [Three centuries of random lines: from Buffon’s needle to scale-invariant networks](https://wilfridskendall.github.io/talks/Kozani-Cacoullos-2024/Kozani-Cacoullos-2024-handout.pdf).

**Abstract:** ... (a) the history of some stochastic geometry  dating from Buffon’s famous thought-experiment concerning baguettes,  through (b) a variety of proposed geometric models for city and traffic  flow, to (c) a general and intuitive description of the author’s results concerning a recent approach to spatial transportation networks. There  should be something of interest for all (including audience  participation in design of a statistical experiment with stochastic  geometry overtones)

**Keywords:** Buffon’s needle; Poisson line patterns; spatial transportation models.

#### 15 May 2024, Markov chain Monte Carlo and Perfect Simulation (Thessaloniki, Greece)

Seminar for graduate students (45 minutes) [Markov chain Monte Carlo and Perfect Simulation](https://wilfridskendall.github.io/talks/Thessaloniki-2024/Thessaloniki-2024-handout.pdf).

**Abstract:** Dating back as far as the classic Metropolis et al.  (1953) paper,  approximate samples  have been drawn by engineers, mathematicians,  physicists and statisticians from probability densities with unknown  normalizing constants, by considering long-time runs of Markov chains  designed to have the desired probability density as equilibrium. In all  but the most trivial instances, a major question is: how long should one run the Markov chain in order for it to be approximately in  equilibrium? Propp and Wilson (1996) made a major breakthrough by  showing that (in favourable cases) one can achieve an exact draw from  equilibrium by (a) running the chain for a random not a deterministic  length of time, and (b) running it from the far past till now rather  than from now till the far future, and (c) using ingenious coupling.  This idea is variously called Coupling from the Past (CFTP), Exact  Simulation or Perfect Simulation; wide-ranging reviews can be found in  Kendall (2005) and Huber (2015). In this talk I will review CFTP and  some of its developments. I shall describe how CFTP works in a simple  case, discuss the very visual example of “dead leaves” from stochastic  geometry, review the work of Connor and myself (2015) on perfect  simulation for multiserver queues, and describe some work in progress by Connor and myself on the application of perfect simulation to some  inference problems for the S-I-R epidemic.

**Keywords:** Coupling from the Past (CFTP); Dead  Leaves; Epidemics; Exact Simulation; Markov Chain Monte Carlo;  Multiserver Queues; Perfect Simulation.
