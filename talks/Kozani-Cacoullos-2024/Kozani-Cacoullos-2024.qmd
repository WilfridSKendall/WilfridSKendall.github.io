abstract: "This talk will focus on (a) the history of some stochastic geometry dating from Buffon's famous thought-experiment concerning baguettes, through (b) a variety of proposed geometric models for city and traffic flow, to (c) a general and intuitive description of a recent approach to spatial transportation networks. It is intended that there should be something of interest for everyone (including an opportunity for audience participation concerning design of a statistical experiment with stochastic geometry overtones)."

I count it a real honour to be invited to present the second Theo Cacoullos Memorial lecture.

These remarks on his presentational style make it clear that Theo Cacoullos Memorial lecturers have much to live up to!
I will do my very best.

* Nearly half a century ago, I assisted in a study 
[@LaslettKendallGleadowDuddy-1982]
of 
fission track lengths in apatite crystals (tracks from fission of \({}^{238}\text{U}\) nuclei; 
crystal is sliced then etched to reveal intercepting tracks);
\note[item]{Apatite crystals as silent sensors of continental drift!}
\pause

* _In principle_ the length histogram indicates thermal hence geological history; 
but direct observation is massively \alert{biased} by 
\note[item]{Bias is a constant companion in stochastic geometry.}

	(a) length selection bias, 
	(b) truncation (a kind of _Wicksell Problem_), 
	(c) projection effects (if non-horizontal);
\pause

* How to model a pattern of segments? (_Poisson segment process_: a kind of _Boolean model_);
\note[item]{Elegant but simple stochastic model, which (unusually for stochastic geometry)
lends itself at least partially to exact calculation.}
\pause

* How to get good length histogram? (select _horizontal_ enclosed tracks hitting tracks that intersect slice).
\note[item]{Not many tracks qualify under this sampling procedure, but a much clearer picture results.}

Buffon rose from undistinguished origins in the France of the _Ancien Regime_,
to become a major and celebrated philosopher and scientist.
He embodied a remarkable mixture of empiricism and rationalism.
\note[item]{Somehow these later diverged into Anglo-empiricism and Franco-rationalism.}

::: {.column}

 - Comte de Buffon was very interested in probability [read him in @HeyNeugebauerPasca-2010];
\note[item]{The Comte de Buffon was interested in \emph{everything}!}
 
\pause
 - Probability from geometry not gambling;
\note[item]{He was uneasy about the way in which probability arise entirely from gambling considerations,
and wanted a purely geometrical derivation.
So he described his famous experiment of throwing a baguette over his shoulder while walking on a
linearly tiled floor,
and considering the event that the baguette hit a line of the tiling.}

\pause
 - There ensued a whole sub-culture of experimental determinations of $\pi$ [see @Lazzarini-1901; @Stigler-1991], 
\note[item]{There are great stories about experimental determinations of $\pi$: 
for example, recovering war-wounded with time on their hands in time of American civil war, 
basically anyone with plenty of time to spare.}
 
\text{ }\bigskip
 
\pause
 - Most recently at the inaugural UCL Bloomsbury Probability Colloquium March 2024;
\note[item]{March 2024, just after \(\pi\)-day.}

\pause
 - Strips at 3cm, pins at 1.5cm, with 24 intersections out of 45 throws.
\note[item]{Two of the 45 throws are mine.}
 
\pause
 - This estimates \(\pi\approx45/21=2.14\ldots\):
the true value of \(\pi\) lies just inside the \(95\%\) confidence interval!
\note[item]{UCL faculty are busier than injured soldiers of the American civil war.}

Throwing baguettes over one’s shoulder (II)
===========================================
Suppose you have to design such an experiment.

* Unit-length needle, unit-ruled floor. You must choose \(n\) the number of trials.
\note[item]{It will be a matter of balancing your desire to determine \(\pi\) accurately
versus your patience and available time.}

\pause
* The number of successes \(X\) is Binomial(\(n\), \(2/\pi\)).
\note[item]{A nice piece of stochastic geometry: at angle \(\theta\) there is a \(\sin\theta\) bias ...}

\pause
* Measure success by \(1/\sqrt{|2/\pi - X/n|}\).
\note[item]{Square root to ensure integrability if we treat \(X/n\) as Uniform\((0,1)\).}

\pause
* Use your skill and judgement (and your balance between accuracy and patience!)
to decide on total number of trials \(n\in[300,400]\)
\note[item]{Get people to vote!}

\pause
In the next slide, we graph the mean measure of success against \(n\)
to see how much the choice of \(n\) actually makes any difference!

Throwing baguettes over one’s shoulder (III)
===========================================
\note{What is going on here?
I have of course cheated.
The continued fraction expansion of \(\pi\) shows,\\
 \(355/113\) is a particularly good approximation.
\\
So \(X=2\times113=226\) gives a particularly high contribution to the 
expected measure of success when \(n=355\).

\medskip

Why is this of interest for us today?
\par}
\note[item]{There is an implicit ``dualization": randomize lines not baguettes.}
\note[item]{Steinhaus (1930) devised a related approach to measurement of length of fibres in terms
of "line measure" of intersecting lines. This finds enormous practical use today in \emph{stereology},
the science of microscopy: put down a random linear transect, count intersections with cell boundaries,
repeat. It is cost-effective for microscopists to measure this and other geometrical features in that fashion.}
\note[item]{Much of the content of stereology then concerns resolution of bias!}
\note[item]{And so we are led to questions of random lines and patterns of lines.}

Poisson line processes {#sec-plp}
======================
![Poisson line process](image/city.png){width=1in}

* Parametrization (actually coordinatization of once-punctured projective plane) [@ChiuStoyanKendallMecke-2013]:
	- invariant measure $\tfrac12 \text{d}r \, \text{d}\theta$ ;
	- Higher-dimensional analogues _eg_ of lines in 3-space;
* Alternate parametrization:
	- invariant measure now $\tfrac12 \sin\phi \; \text{d}r \, \text{d}\phi$;
* Random line pattern using _Poisson point process_:
	- mention “void probability” approach;
* Simple (standard) line-process calculations:
	- mean number of lines hitting segment equals segment length;
	- mean number of lines hitting two sides a and b of a triangle but missing side c equals (a+b-c)/2;
	- mean number of lines passing through two opposing sides of a rectangle (two other sides of length b, and diagonals of length f) equals (2f  2b)/2 = f-b.
* Notion of “conditioning on a line at the origin”: Slivnyak, _Palm probability_, extremely useful in showing how to reason with general constructions;
* Marks, _eg_ speed-marked line process (write down intensity measure on state space).

Also: some results concerning (a) efficiency criteria and (b) traffic flow in Poisson line networks.

Stochastic geometry of online maps {#sec-stochgeom}
==================================
![All the roads in South America](image/SouthAmericaRoadsDark.jpg){height=3in}

---

* Modelling transportation systems;
* Visual approach to axioms for online maps:	- Holland and Northwest Germany;
	- Generating networks by a (random) mechanism;
	- Axioms:
		1. Scale invariance	;
		2. Finite mean-length;
		3. “SIRSN” property (Scale-Invariant Random Spatial Network).
	- Bertrand Russell: “The axiomatic method has many advantages over honest work.”
	- Settling the existential question:	 
	 	- randomized dyadic speed-marked planar lattice [@Aldous-2012];
	 	- speed-marked Poisson line process [@Aldous-2012; @Kendall-2014c; @Kahn-2015] using the line process theory discussed above.
* More realistic models:
	 - Sticks instead of lines;
	 - Thick stick soup;
	 - Thick Pareto stick soup;
	 - Thick stiff fibre soup.

Some further remarks {#sec-conclusion}
====================
![Much more work is still to be done](image/HeathRobinson.jpg){height=3in}

---

* “Thickness” is a simplifying assumption and still has reality problems:
	- using finite-mean-length sticks with infinite second-length-moment, means that _any_ selected stick will have infinite-mean-length (length-biasing!);
	- reasonable to suppose that it suffices to have super-critical percolation for the configuration of fibres of greated than unit speed;
	- But stick percolation is _hard_! Still working to try to develop some relevant theory.
* Everything still works for lines in higher-dimensional space:
	- Dimension 3 is currently the only other case of interest (could be of interest when studying the human connective!);
	- Blanc has recently published nice work on an analogue in hyperbolic space.
* A big attraction of the theory in its present state is that one can consider relaxing parts of the scaling symmetry assumption. The “SIRSN effect” (Axiom 3) is probably still going to work if controlled spatial inhomogeneity is allowed. So this approach now provides a flexible framework for statistical and operational research modelling.
* We can introduce traffic, for example by supposing traffic along the connecting route to be uniformly generated between any pair of points. @Gameros-2017 worked this out for a simpler model and compared it to empirical results concerning British rail traffic before and after the 1960’s Beeching railway cuts.
