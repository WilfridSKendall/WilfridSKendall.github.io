# Three centuries of random lines: from Buffon's needle to scale-invariant networks
## Theo Cacoullos Memorial Lecture 2024
## Wilfrid S Kendall
## 15 May 2024

**Abstract:**
This talk will focus on (a) the history of some stochastic geometry dating from Buffon's famous thought-experiment concerning baguettes, through (b) a variety of proposed geometric models for city and traffic flow, to (c) a general and intuitive description of the author’s results concerning a recent approach to spatial transportation networks. There should be something of interest for all (including audience participation in design of a statistical experiment with stochastic geometry overtones)

**Keywords:** Buffon’s needle; Poisson line patterns; spatial transportation models
