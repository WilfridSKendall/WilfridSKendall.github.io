abstract = {In this paper we establish a strong decoupling inequality for the cylinder's percolation process introduced by Tykesson and Windisch in arXiv:1010.5338 . This model features a very strong dependency structure, making it difficult to study, and this is why such decoupling inequalities are desirable. It is important to notice that the type of dependencies featured by cylinder's percolation is particularly intricate, given that the cylinders have infinite range (unlike some models like Boolean percolation) while at the same time being rigid bodies (unlike processes such as Random Interlacements). Our work introduces a new notion of fast decoupling, proves that it holds for the model in question and finishes with an application. More precisely, we prove that for a small enough density of cylinders, a random walk on a connected component of the vacant set is transient for all dimensions {\$}d \backslashgeq 3{\$}.},

abstract = {Consider the following random spatial network: in a large disk, construct a network using a stationary and isotropic Poisson line process of unit intensity. Connect pairs of points using the network, with initial/final segments of the connecting path formed by travelling off the network in the opposite direction to that of the destination/source. Suppose further that connections are established using ‘near geodesics', constructed between pairs of points using the perimeter of the cell containing these two points and formed using only the Poisson lines not separating them. If each pair of points generates an infinitesimal amount of traffic divided equally between the two connecting near geodesics, and if the Poisson line pattern is conditioned to contain a line through the centre, then what can be said about the total flow through the centre? In Kendall (2011) it was shown that a scaled version of this flow has asymptotic distribution given by the 4-volume of a region in 4-space, constructed using an improper anisotropic Poisson line process in an infinite planar strip. Here we construct a more amenable representation in terms of two ‘seminal curves' defined by the improper Poisson line process, and establish results which produce a framework for effective simulation from this distribution up to an L 1 error which tends to 0 with increasing computational effort.},

abstract = {The transportation problem can be formalized as the problem of finding the optimal way to transport a given measure into another with the same mass. In contrast to the Monge-Kantorovitch problem, recent approaches model the branched structure of such supply networks as minima of an energy functional whose essential feature is to favour wide roads. Such a branched structure is observable in ground transportation networks, in draining and irrigation systems, in electrical power supply systems, and in natural counterparts such as blood vessels or the branches of trees. These lectures provide mathematical proof of several existence, structure and regularity properties, empirically observed in transportation networks. The link with previous discrete physical models of irrigation and erosion models in geomorphology and with discrete telecommunication and transportation models is discussed. It will be mathematically proven that the majority fit in the simple model sketched in this volume.},

@article{Turner-2007,
abstract = {We consider sequences (XtN)t≥0 of Markov processes in two dimensions whose fluid limit is a stable solution of an ordinary differential equation of the form it =b(xt), where b(x) = (0 $\lambda$-$\mu$ 0)x + $\tau$(x) for some $\lambda$, $\mu$ {\textgreater} 0 and $\tau$(x) = O(|x|2). Here the processes are indexed so that the variance of the fluctuations of XtN is inversely proportional to N. The simplest example arises from the OK Corral gunfight model which was formulated by Williams and McIlroy [Bull. London Math. Soc. 30 (1998) 166-170] and studied by Kingman [Bull. London Math. Soc. 31 (1999) 601-606], These processes exhibit their most interesting behavior at times of order log N so it is necessary to establish a fluid limit that is valid for large times. We find that this limit is inherently random and obtain its distribution. Using this, it is possible to derive scaling limits for the points where these processes hit straight lines through the origin, and the minimum distance from the origin that they can attain. The power of N that gives the appropriate scaling is surprising. For example if T is the time that XtN first hits one of the lines y = x or y = -x, then N $\mu$/(2($\lambda$+$\mu$))|XTN| ⇒ |Z| $\mu$/($\lambda$+$\mu$)for some zero mean Gaussian random variable Z. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2007.},

abstract = {Let $\Xi$ be a discrete set in {\{}$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\^{}}d. Call the elements
of $\Xi$ centers. The well-known Voronoi tessellation partitions
{\{}$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\^{}}d into polyhedral regions (of varying sizes) by allocating
each site of {\{}$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\^{}}d to the closest center. Here we study
``fair'' allocations of {\{}$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\^{}}d to $\Xi$ in which the regions
allocated to different centers have equal volumes. We prove that
if $\Xi$ is obtained from a translation-invariant point process,
then there is a unique fair allocation which is stable in the sense
of the Gale--Shapley marriage problem. (I.e., sites and centers both
prefer to be allocated as close as possible, and an allocation is
said to be unstable if some site and center both prefer each other
over their current allocations.) We show that the region allocated
to each center $\xi$ is a union of finitely many bounded connected
sets. However, in the case of a Poisson process, an infinite volume
of sites are allocated to centers further away than $\xi$. We prove
power law lower bounds on the allocation distance of a typical site.
It is an open problem to prove any upper bound in d{\textgreater}1.},

abstract = {In recent years, a lot of attention has been paid to carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and their applications to electronic devices. Many studies concentrate on the percolation threshold and the characterization of the conduction in such materials. Nevertheless, no theoretical study has yet attempted to characterize the CNT features inside finite size CNT networks. We present a theoretical approach based on geometrical and statistical considerations. We demonstrate the possibility of explicitly determining some relations existing between two neighbor CNTs and their contact efficiency in random networks of identical CNTs. We calculate the contact probability of rigid identical CNTs and we obtain a probability of 0.2027, which turns out to be independent of the CNT density. Based on this probability, we establish also the dependence of the number of contacts per CNT as a function of the CNT density. All the theoretical results are validated by very good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{KiousMaillerSchapira-2022,
abstract = {It is well-known in biology that ants are able to find shortest paths between their nest and the food by successive random explorations, without any mean of communication other than the pheromones they leave behind them. This striking phenomenon has been observed experimentally and modelled by different mean-field reinforcement-learning models in the biology literature. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic reinforcement-learning model for this phenomenon. In this model, the ants explore a finite graph in which two nodes are distinguished as the nest and the source of food. The ants perform successive random walks on this graph, starting from the nest and stopped when first reaching the food, and the transition probabilities of each random walk depend on the realizations of all previous walks through some dynamic weighting of the graph. We discuss different variants of this model based on different reinforcement rules and show that slight changes in this reinforcement rule can lead to drastically different outcomes. We prove that, in two variants of this model and when the underlying graph is, respectively, any series-parallel graph and a 5-edge non-series-parallel losange graph, the ants indeed eventually find the shortest path(s) between their nest and the food. Both proofs rely on the electrical network method for random walks on weighted graphs and on Rubin's embedding in continuous time. The proof in the series-parallel cases uses the recursive nature of this family of graphs, while the proof in the seemingly-simpler losange case turns out to be quite intricate: it relies on a fine analysis of some stochastic approximation, and on various couplings with standard and generalised P$\backslash$'olya urns.},

At time zero, for each and every i, a line-segment Li starts growing at unit rate around the point Pi in the direction $\theta$i, the point Pi remaining at the centre of Li; each line-segment, under Model 1, ceases growth when one of its ends hits another line, while under Model 2, its growth ceases either when one of its ends hits another line or when it is hit by the growing end of some other line. The paper shows that these procedures are well defined and gives constructive algorithms to compute the half-lengths Ri of all Li. Moreover, it specifies assumptions under which stochastic versions, i.e. models based on point processes, exist. Afterwards, it deals with the question as to whether there is percolation in Model 1.

abstract = {Road network robustness is the ability of a road network to operate correctly under a wide range of attacks. A structural robustness analysis can describe the survivability of a city road network that is under attack and can help improve functions such as urban planning and emergency response. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to quantitatively evaluate road network robustness based on the community structure derived from a city road network, in which communities refer to those densely connected sub- sets of nodes that are sparsely linked to the remaining network. First, a road network is reconstructed into a set of connected communities. Then, successive simulated attacks are conducted on the recon- structed road networks to test the performance of the networks under attack. The performance of the networks is represented by efficiency and the occurrence of fragmentation. Three attack strategies, including a random attack and two intentional attacks, are performed to evaluate the survivability of the road network under different situations. Contrary to the traditional road segment-based approach, the community-based robustness analysis on a city road network shows distinct structural diversity between communities, providing greater insight into network vulnerability under intentional attacks. Six typical city road networks on three different continents are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The evaluation results reveal an important feature of the structure of city road networks from a community-based perspective, i.e., that the structure is robust under random failure but fragile under intentional attack. This result is highly consistent in different city road network forms.},

abstract = {A sequence (Xn) of random variables adapted to an ascending (asc.) sequence n of [sigma]-algebras is an amart iff EX[tau] converges as [tau] runs over the set T of bounded stopping times. An analogous definition is given for a descending (desc.) sequence n. A systematic treatment of amarts is given. Some results are: Martingales and quasimartingales are amarts. Supremum and infimum of two amarts are amarts (in the asc. case assuming L1-boundedness). A desc. amart and an asc. L1-bounded amart converge a.e. (Theorem 2.3; only the desc. case is new). In the desc. case, an adapted sequence such that (EX[tau])[tau][set membership, variant]T is bounded is uniformly integrable (Theorem 2.9). If Xn is an amart such that supnE(Xn - Xn-1)2 {\textless} [infinity], then Xn/n converges a.e. (Theorem 3.3). An asc. amart can be written uniquely as Yn + Zn where Yn is a martingale, and Zn --{\textgreater} 0 in L1. Then Zn --{\textgreater} 0 a.e. and Z[tau] is uniformly integrable (Theorem 3.2). If Xn is an asc. amart, [tau]k a sequence of bounded stopping times, k {\textless}= [tau]k, and E(supk X[tau]k - Xk-1) {\textless} [infinity], then there exists a set G such that Xn --{\textgreater} a.e. on G and lim inf Xn = -[infinity], lim sup Xn = +[infinity] on Gc (Theorem 2.7). Let E be a Banach space with the Radon-Nikodym property and separable dual. In the definition of an E-valued amart, Pettis integral is used. A desc. amart converges a.e. on the set {\{}lim sup ||Xn|| {\textless} [infinity]{\}}. An asc. or desc. amart converges a.e. weakly if supT E||X[tau]|| {\textless} [infinity] (Theorem 5.2; only the desc. case is new).},

abstract = {We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.},

abstract = {This note compares some current theoretical mathematical work on spatial networks with data on inter-city road networks within States. In designing a network, a natural constraint is the total length, and a natural objective is to want the route length {\$}\backslashell((i, j){\$} between typical cities {\$}i{\$}, {\$}j{\$} to be not much longer than straight line distance {\$}d(i, j){\$}. Write {\$}r(i, j) = \backslashell(i,j){\$} for the excess route-length. With an {\$}n{\$}-city network there are {\$}\backslashbinom{\{}n{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} such numbers {\$}r(i,j){\$}. A recent theoretical insight is that, from a mathematical viewpoint, a good way to combine these into a single “route-length efficiency” statistic {\$}R{\^{}}∗{\$} is to define {\$}R{\^{}}∗{\$} as the maximum over {\$}d{\$} of the average of {\$}r(i, j){\$} over city-pairs with {\$}d(i,j) \backslashapprox d{\$}. The optimal trade-off between total network length and {\$}R{\^{}}∗{\$} is discussed elsewhere in a theoretical model of randomly-placed cities. What about real networks? For each of {\$}10{\$} {\{}U.S.{\}} States we studied the road network linking the {\$}20{\$} largest cities. In this note we present the data and discuss the relationship between data and the predictions from theory.},

In the first chapters, we give self-contained proofs of seminal results obtained in the '80s and '90s on limit shapes and geodesics, while covering the state of the art of these questions. Second, aside from these classical results, we discuss recent perspectives and directions including (1) the connection between Busemann functions and geodesics, (2) the proof of sublinear variance under 2+log moments of passage times and (3) the role of growth and competition models. We also provide a collection of (old and new) open questions, hoping to solve them before the 100th birthday.},

Results on related first-passage percolation problems lead us to postulate that the statistics of balls in these random metrics belong to the Kardar¡VParisi¡VZhang universality class of surface kinetic roughening, with {\pounds}i and {\pounds}q relating to critical exponents characterizing a corresponding interface growth process. Moreover, we check that the one-point and two-point correlators converge to the behavior expected for the Airy-2 process characterized by the Tracy¡VWidom (TW) probability distribution function of the largest eigenvalue of large random matrices in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Nevertheless extreme-value statistics of ball coordinates are given by theTWdistribution associated with random matrices in the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble.

abstract = {Common cluster models for multi-type point processes model the aggregation of points of the same type. In complete contrast, in the study of Anglo-Saxon settlements it is hypothesized that administrative clusters involving complementary names tend to appear. We investigate the evidence for such a hypothesis by developing a Bayesian Random Partition Model based on clusters formed by points of different types (complementary clustering). As a result, we obtain an intractable posterior distribution on the space of matchings contained in a k-partite hypergraph. We apply the Metropolis- Hastings (MH) algorithm to sample from this posterior. We consider the problem of choosing an efficient MH proposal distribution and we obtain consistent mixing improvements compared to the choices found in the literature. Simulated Tempering techniques can be used to overcome multimodality and a multiple proposal scheme is developed to allow for parallel programming. Finally, we discuss results arising from the careful use of convergence diagnostic techniques. This allows us to study a data set including locations and place-names of 1316 Anglo-Saxon settlements dated approximately around 750-850 AD. Without strong prior knowledge, the model allows for explicit estimation of the number of clusters, the average intra-cluster dispersion and the level of interaction among place-names. The results support the hypothesis of organization of settlements into administrative clusters based on complementary names.},

abstract = {A map is proposed from the space of planar surface fracture networks to a four-parameter mathematical space, summarizing the average topological connectivity and geometrical properties of a network idealized as a convex polygonal mesh. The four parameters are identified as the average number of nodes and edges, the angular defect with respect to regular polygons, and the isoperimetric ratio. The map serves as a low-dimensional signature of the fracture network and is visually presented as a pair of three-dimensional graphs. A systematic study is made of a wide collection of real crack networks for various materials, collected from different sources. To identify the characteristics of the real materials, several well-known mathematical models of convex polygonal networks are presented and worked out. These geometric models may correspond to different physical fracturing processes. The proposed map is shown to be discriminative, and the points corresponding to materials of similar properties are found to form closely spaced groups in the parameter space. Results for the real and simulated systems are compared in an attempt to identify crack networks of unknown materials.},

abstract = {Recent statistical methods fitted on large-scale GPS data can provide accurate estimations of the expected travel time between two points. However, little is known about the distribution of travel time, which is key to decision-making across a number of logistic problems. With sufficient data, single road-segment travel time can be well approximated. The challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate such information over a route to arrive at the route-distribution of travel time. We develop a novel statistical approach to this problem. We show that, under general conditions, without assuming a distribution of speed, travel time {\{}divided by route distance follows a Gaussian distribution with route-invariant population mean and variance. We develop efficient inference methods for such parameters and propose asymptotically tight population prediction intervals for travel time. Using traffic flow information, we further develop a trip-specific Gaussian-based predictive distribution, resulting in tight prediction intervals for short and long trips. Our methods, implemented in an R-package, are illustrated in a real-world case study using mobile GPS data, showing that our trip-specific and population intervals both achieve the 95$\backslash${\%} theoretical coverage levels. Compared to alternative approaches, our trip-specific predictive distribution achieves (a) the theoretical coverage at every level of significance, (b) tighter prediction intervals, (c) less predictive bias, and (d) more efficient estimation and prediction procedures. This makes our approach promising for low-latency, large-scale transportation applications.}},

The book is divided into three parts. The first part concentrates on statistics on the circle. Topics covered include tests of uniformity, tests of good-of-fit, inference on von Mises distributions and non-parametric methods. The second part considers statistics on spheres of arbitrary dimension, and includes a detailed account of inference on the main distributions on spheres. Recent material on correlation, regression time series, robust techniques, bootstrap methods, density estimation and curve fitting is presented. The third part considers statistics on more general sample spaces, in particular rotation groups, Stiefel manifolds, Grassmann manifolds and complex projective spaces. Shape analysis is considered from the perspective of directional statistics. Written by leading authors in the field, this text will be invaluable not only to researchers in probability and statistics interested in the latest developments in directional statistics, but also to practitioners and researchers in many scientific fields, including astronomy, biology, computer vision, earth sciences and image analysis.},

The model addresses factors that make locations attractive for trade and settlement, affecting settlement growth and change. We explore why some sites become relatively major settlements, while others diminish in the periods discussed. We assess how political and geographic constraints affect regional settlement transformations, while also accounting for uncertainty in the archaeological data. Model outputs indicate how the MBA settlement pattern contrasts from the IA for the same region when different factors affecting settlement size importance, facility of movement, and exogenous site interactions are studied. The results suggest the importance of political and historical factors in these periods and also demonstrate the value of a quantitative model in explaining emergent settlement size distributions across landscapes affected by different socio-environmental causal elements. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

Being local means, roughly, determined by the local behavior of the sample paths of the Brownian motion, and stationary means invariant relative to the L$\backslash$'evy shifts of the sample paths. We answer to the affirmative Tsirelson's question, whether or not there are any others, and develop some general theory for such sets. An extra ingredient to their structure, that of an honest indexation, leads to a splitting result that is akin to the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the Brownian motion at the minimum (or maximum) and has the latter as a special case. Sets admitting an honest indexation are moreover shown to have the property that no stopping time belongs to them with positive probability. They are also minimal: they do not have any non-empty proper local stationary subsets. Random sets, of the kind studied in this paper, honestly indexed or otherwise, give rise to nonclassical one-dimensional noises, generalizing the noise of splitting. Some properties of these noises and the inter-relations between them are investigated. In particular, subsets are connected to subnoises.},

This new network model also accounts for the complex interaction of protofibrils with each other, effect of presence of solvent, Coulombic attraction and other binding forces. The network model is applied to simulate the force extension behavior of single fibrin fiber from atomic force microscopy experiments and shows good agreement. Thus validated fibrin fiber network model is then combined with a modified version of Arruda-Boyce eight chain model to estimate the force extension behavior of continuum level fibrin clot, which shows very good correlation. The results show that this network model is able to predict the behavior of fibrin fibers as well as fibrin clot at small strains, large strains and even closer to the break strain. We use the network model to explain why the fibrin clots and fibers doesn't behave like a worm like chain, instead behaves like a nonlinear spring.},

abstract = {The stationary isotropic Poisson line network was
used to derive upper bounds on mean excess network-geodesic length
in Aldous and Kendall (2008). This new paper presents a study of
the geometry and fluctuations of near-geodesics in such a network.
The notion of a "Poissonian city" is introduced, in which
connections between pairs of nodes are made using simple
"no-overshoot" paths based on the Poisson line process.
Asymptotics for geometric features and random variation in length
are computed for such near-geodesic paths; it is shown that they
traverse the network with an order of efficiency comparable to
that of true network geodesics. Mean characteristics and limiting
behaviour at the centre are computed for a natural network flow.
Comparisons are drawn with similar network flows in a city based
on a comparable rectilinear grid. A concluding section discusses
several open problems.},

abstract = {This paper gives a comprehensive treatment of local uniqueness, asymptotics and numerics for intrinsic means on the circle. It turns out that local uniqueness as well as rates of convergence are governed by the distribution near the antipode. In a nutshell, if the distribution there is locally less than uniform, we have local uniqueness and asymptotic normality with a rate of n−1/2. With increased proximity to the uniform distribution the rate can be arbitrarly slow, and in the limit, local uniqueness is lost. Further, we give general distributional conditions, e.g. unimodality, that ensure global uniqueness. Along the way, we discover that sample means can occur only at the vertices of a regular polygon which allows to compute intrinsic sample means in linear time from sorted data. This algorithm is finally applied in a simulation study demonstrating the dependence of the convergence rates on the behavior of the density at the antipode.},

abstract = {We analyze the disordered Riemannian geometry resulting from random perturbations of the Euclidean metric. We focus on geodesics, the paths traced out by a particle traveling in this quenched random environment. By taking the point of the view of the particle, we show that the law of its observed environment is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the random metric, and we provide an explicit form for its Radon-Nikodym derivative. We use this result to prove a "local Markov property" along an unbounded geodesic, demonstrating that it eventually encounters any type of geometric phenomenon. We also develop in this paper some general results on conditional Gaussian measures. Our Main Theorem states that a geodesic chosen with random initial conditions (chosen independently of the metric) is almost surely not minimizing. To demonstrate this, we show that a minimizing geodesic is guaranteed to eventually pass over a certain "bump surface," which locally has constant positive curvature. By using Jacobi fields, we show that this is sufficient to destabilize the minimizing property. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The topology and meta-information coevolve together as the cities are developed. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the topology and meta-information for a street network, which has aspects of both a complex network and planar graph. The degree of organization of a street structure determines the efficiency and productivity of the city in that they act as blood vessels to transport people, goods, and information. We analyze the topological aspect of a street network using centrali- ties including the betweenness, closeness, straightness, and information. We classify the cities into several groups that share common meta-information based on the centrality, indicating that the topological factor of the street structure is closely related to meta- information through coevolution. We also obtain the coevolution in the planned cities using the regularity. Another footprint is the relation between the street segment length and the population, which shows the sublinear scaling.},

abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

abstract = {A significant problem with most functional data analyses is that of mis- aligned curves. Without adjustment, even an analysis as simple as estima- tion of the mean will fail. One common method to synchronize a set of curves involves equating “landmarks” such as peaks or troughs. The land- marks method can work well but will fail if marker events can not be identi- fied or are missing from some curves. An alternative approach, the “continu- ous monotone registration” method, works by transforming the curves so that they are as close as possible to a target function. This method can also perform well but is highly dependent on identifying an accurate target function. We develop an alignmentmethod based on equating the “moments” of a given set of curves. These moments are intended to capture the locations of important features which may represent local behavior, such as maximums and mini- mums, ormore global characteristics, such as the slope of the curve averaged over time. Our method works by equating the moments of the curves while also shrinking toward a common shape. This allows us to capture the advan- tages of both the landmark and continuous monotone registration approaches. The method is illustrated on several data sets and a simulation study is per- formed.},

abstract = {Stochastic geometry has in recent years experienced considerable progress, both in its applications to other sciences and engineering, and in its theoretical foundations and mathematical expansion. This book, by two eminent specialists of the subject, provides a solid mathematical treatment of the basic models of stochastic geometry - random sets, point processes of geometric objects (particles, flats), and random mosaics. It develops, in a measure-theoretic setting, the integral geometry for the motion and the translation group, as needed for the investigation of these models under the usual invariance assumptions. A characteristic of the book is the interplay between stochastic and geometric arguments, leading to various major results. Its main theme, once the foundations have been laid, is the quantitative investigation of the basic models. This comprises the introduction of suitable parameters, in the form of functional densities, relations between them, and approaches to their estimation. Much additional information on stochastic geometry is collected in the section notes.},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
annote = {This book has been published in the series "Probability and its Applications''. The book starts with a preface that does an excellent job of setting the scene and explaining the contents. In particular, it introduces the reader to the main aims of the book: (1) to give a sound mathematical foundation for the most basic and general models of stochastic geometry; (2) to consider the parts of integral geometry that are relevant for the applications in stochastic geometry (i.e. selected concepts from integral geometry are tailored for use in stochastic geometry); (3) to demonstrate such applications. The book consists of the following four parts: (I) Foundations of Stochastic Geometry, (II) Integral Geometry, (III) Selected Topics from Stochastic Geometry and (IV) Appendix, and contains 14 chapters. Chapter 1, titled "Prolog'', is devoted to explaining the main structure of the book. Since the book is about relations between stochastic geometry and integral geometry, the authors begin with an imaginary experiment that leads to a basic model of stochastic geometry. The presentation of stochastic geometry in the book is restricted to the aims of laying a sound foundation for the standard models of stochastic geometry and of preparing and describing the use of integral geometry. Therefore, in Section 1.2 the authors provide pointers to additional supplementary literature. 
   The first part, "Foundations of Stochastic Geometry'', is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 2, titled "Random closed sets'', is an introduction to general random closed sets in a topological space E. The basic space E is assumed to be locally compact and to have a countable base. Section 2.1 considers the system F of its closed subsets, equipped with the topology of closed convergence and the induced $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets. The distribution of a random closed set is completely determined by certain hitting probabilities, in particular, by its capacity functional. This gives, for every compact set C⊂E, the probability that the random set has nonempty intersection with C. The capacity functional can be seen in a certain analogy to the distribution function of a real random variable. Like distribution functions, the possible capacity functionals can be completely characterized. This characterization is provided by the Choquet theorem; a proof of this result can be found in Section 2.2. Some applications of this theorem are treated in Section 2.3. Special features of random closed sets in Euclidean spaces are the subject of Section 2.4. Chapter 3, titled "Point processes'', considers point processes and marked point processes. In Section 3.1 point processes are introduced as random counting measures and therefore general random measures are treated as well. Poisson processes are the subject of Section 3.2. Palm distributions of random measures and point processes are treated, with two different approaches, in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Section 3.5, on marked point processes, lays some foundations for the treatment of geometric models. Section 3.6 represents point processes of closed sets. Chapter 4, titled "Geometric models'', is devoted to the study of geometric processes in Rd and the random sets derived from them. A geometric process in Rd is a point process of closed sets which is concentrated on geometrically distinguished subclasses of F (= the system of nonempty closed subsets of E). Section 4.1 considers particle processes. Section 4.2 establishes a connection between particle processes and marked point processes (in particular, the germ-grain processes, where compact sets serve as marks). Section 4.3 considers an important example of random closed sets, the germ-grain models which are generated from germ-grain processes. The Boolean models, derived from Poisson processes, are an especially tractable subclass. Section 4.4 is devoted to flat processes. Of particular interest are the processes arising from flat processes by intersections, either with a fixed plane or by intersecting fixed numbers of the flats in the process. Some assertions about the intensities and the directional distributions of these derived processes are obtained, mainly in the case of Poisson processes. Special cases of fiber and surface processes are treated in Section 4.5. Section 4.6 is concerned with a set-valued parameter, which can be attached to different processes of geometric objects. 
   The second part, "Integral Geometry'', is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 5, titled "Averaging with invariant measures'', develops the basic tools, namely intersection formulas for fixed and moving geometric objects, where suitable geometric quantities of the intersections are integrated with respect to invariant measures. The main purpose of Section 5.1 is the calculation of general kinematic integrals of the form 
∫Gd$\phi$(K∩gM)$\mu$(dg)
for convex bodies K, M in Rd, where Gd is the motion group of Rd, and the integration is with respect to its Haar measure $\mu$. The integral takes a simple form if the functional $\phi$ satisfies two natural assumptions, additivity and continuity. This result is known as Hadwiger's general integral geometric theorem (see Theorem 5.1.2). The assumptions on $\phi$ are satisfied, in particular, by the intrinsic volumes Vj. The purpose of the two subsequent sections is a derivation of the principal kinematic formula for curvature measures. Section 5.2 treats only integrations over the translation group, and Section 5.3 then deals with the additional integrations over the rotation group. Section 5.4 leaves the domain of convex or polyconvex (that is, can be represented as a finite union of convex bodies) sets and studies translative, kinematic and Crofton formulas for Hausdorff rectifiable sets and the Hausdorff measures of their intersections. Chapter 6, titled "Extended concepts of integral geometry'', derives further integral geometric formulas for convex bodies. In Sections 6.1 and 6.2, versions of the principal kinematic formula are obtained. Section 6.3 derives a local kinematic formula and also a formula that combines sections with projections. Section 6.4 is devoted to a continuation on translative integral geometry. The authors treat iterated translative formulas, which involve a more general series of mixed measures, and consider rotation means and results of Crofton type for the mixed measures. The integral formulas for mixed measures and their global versions, the mixed functionals, also yield kinematic formulas for certain mixed volumes and for projection functions and support functions of convex bodies. Section 6.5 provides an introduction to the integral geometry of spherically convex sets in the spherical space Sd−1. Chapter 7, titled "Integral geometric transformations'', is devoted to transformation formulas for integrals over various spaces of geometric objects. In principle, the required transformation formulas are just versions of the transformation rule for multiple integrals under differentiable mappings. However, since the mappings are defined by geometric operations, the Jacobians have geometric interpretations, and therefore direct geometric arguments are often simpler than the use of special parameterizations. The transformation formulas have various applications in stochastic geometry, for example, in the investigation of convex hulls of random points (Chapter 8), and the study of random mosaics (Chapter 10). The first section provides simple rules for invariant measures on flag spaces. In Section 7.2 Blaschke-Petkantschin formulas are proved. In Section 7.3 two formulas of Blaschke-Petkantschin type are proved, where the pivots are spheres. 
   The third part, "Selected Topics from Stochastic Geometry'', is divided into 4 chapters. Chapter 8, titled "Some geometric probability problems'', is devoted to selected geometric probability problems. Section 8.1 provides early historical examples of geometric probability problems. Section 8.2 considers convex hulls of random points. Section 8.3 applies spherical integral geometry to random projections of polytopes, and Section 8.4 treats randomly moving convex bodies and flats by means of Euclidean integral geometry. Section 8.5 develops a theory of randomly touching convex bodies. Section 8.6 is devoted to various inequalities for geometric probabilities and expectations of geometric random variables related to convex bodies. Chapter 9, titled "Mean values for random sets'', returns to the mainstream of the book and proceeds with a quantitative treatment of stationary random closed sets and particle processes. Section 9.1 shows how some characteristic parameters of random closed sets specialize in the case of stationary (and possibly isotropic) Boolean models, in particular, those with convex grains, and then appear in rather explicit formulas. The main purpose of Section 9.2 is the specification of a class of stationary random sets Z (with locally polyconvex realizations) and a class of functionals $\phi$ (defined on polyconvex sets) such that the limit 
$\phi$¯¯¯(Z):=limr→$\infty$E$\phi$(Z∩rW)Vd(rW)
exists for every convex body W with the volume Vd(W){\textgreater}0 (here E is the mathematical expectation). The parameter $\phi$¯¯¯(Z) is called the $\phi$-density of Z. Important (but not the only) examples of functionals satisfying the assumptions are the intrinsic volumes (or Minkowski functionals) V0,{\ldots},Vd−1. It may even happen, under suitable assumptions, that the limit limr→$\infty$$\phi$(Z∩rW)Vd(rW) exists P-almost surely and is a constant, which is then equal to $\phi$¯¯¯(Z). This ergodic approach to densities is described in Section 9.3. In Section 9.4, results from integral geometry are employed to derive various formulas which are useful in density estimation from observations of realizations of the random set within a bounded sampling window, or from observations in a lower-dimensional section. Mathematical principles of further estimation procedures are the topic of Section 9.5. Chapter 10, titled "Random mosaics'', gives a detailed treatment of stationary random mosaics, another basic model of stochastic geometry. After a careful introduction (Section 10.1), particular attention is paid to tessellations induced by stationary Poisson processes, either as Voronoĭ or Delaunay tessellations corresponding to Poisson point processes (Section 10.2), or as hyperplane tessellations generated by a Poisson process in the space of hyperplanes (Section 10.3). Zero cells and typical cells of stationary random mosaics provide interesting examples of random polytopes and are studied in some detail (Section 10.4). Section 10.5 proves mixing properties of special mosaics induced by stationary Poisson processes. In particular, stationary Voronoĭ and Delaunay mosaics are mixing (see Theorems 10.5.1 and 10.5.2). Chapter 11, titled "Non-stationarity models'', is an outlook to non-stationary models for particle processes and Boolean models (Section 11.1), for processes of flats (Section 11.3) and for random mosaics (Section 11.4). In Section 11.2 the authors continue the investigation of general Boolean models Z with convex grains and consider generalized contact distributions. 
   The fourth part, titled "Appendix'', is divided into 3 chapters. The appendix collects basic material from other fields that is needed in the different chapters of the book. Chapter 12, titled "Facts from general topology'', deals with results and facts from topology and Borel measures (Section 12.1). Section 12.2 collects basic notions and results on the topology of the space of closed sets. Section 12.3 considers the special case where the underlying space E is Rd, the d-dimensional Euclidean space, and shows additional features, due to the linear structure of Rd and the properties of its standard metric. Chapter 13, titled "Invariant measures'', is devoted to Haar measures. In Section 13.1 invariance refers to a group operation and thus to a homogeneous space. In Section 13.2, the transformation groups and homogeneous spaces that occur in Euclidean integral geometry are introduced. In Section 13.3 the reader can find a proof of a general uniqueness theorem for relatively invariant measures. Chapter 14, titled "Facts from convex geometry'', is devoted to the geometry of convex bodies. Section 14.1 considers the subspace determinant. Section 14.2 considers the rigid motion invariant intrinsic volumes and their local counterparts, the curvature measures. Section 14.3 is devoted to mixed volumes. Section 14.4 provides general information about additive functionals. Section 14.5 is devoted to Hausdorff measures and rectifiable sets. The appendix may be used as a quick reference source for a number of mathematical concepts that are also useful well outside the scope of this book. The book presents a number of results that are otherwise scattered among an immense number of research papers and mostly provides full proofs for them. Every section ends with bibliographical and historical notes which broaden the perspective and discuss each particular section. The most remarkable aspect of the book is the reader-friendly structure and the style in which it has been written. The book is also worth owning not only for those working in stochastic geometry and immediately related fields of theoretical and applied probability and spatial statistics. With its treatment of probability theory, Haar measures on the topological groups and convex geometry, the book is intended for readers from these fields as well. Each chapter starts with a short introduction in which some of the main references for the topics covered in the chapter are listed. The reader is alerted as to what material from the chapter is required reading and what is not. This book has a good index and index of notations, and a very detailed bibliography (838 references). The importance of the book, from both a practical and theoretical standpoint, is unquestionable. This book, by two eminent specialists of stochastic and integral geometry, will be an essential part of every mathematical library. Reviewed by V. K. Ohanyan

abstract = {Plant differently colored points in the plane; then let random points (“Poisson rain”) fall, and give each new point the color of the nearest existing point. Previous investigation and simulations strongly suggest that the colored regions converge (in some sense) to a random partition of the plane. We prove a weak version of this, showing that normalized empirical measures converge to Lebesgue measures on a random partition into measurable sets. Topological properties remain an open problem. In the course of the proof, which heavily exploits time-reversals, we encounter a novel self-similar process of coalescing planar partitions. In this process, sets A(z) in the partition are associated with Poisson random points z, and the dynamics are as follows. Points are deleted randomly at rate 1; when z is deleted, its set A(z) is adjoined to the set A(z0) of the nearest other point z0. MSC codes 60D05},

We identify the value of the critical bias explicitly, and, in the sub-ballistic regime, we find the polynomial order of the distance moved by the particle. Each of these conclusions is obtained by investigating the geometry of the traps that are most effective at delaying the walk. A key element in proving our results is to understand that, on large scales, the particle trajectory is essentially one-dimensional; we prove such a `dynamic renormalization' statement in a much stronger form than was previously known.},

We divide the image into a set of scanning windows and classify them into two clusters: homogeneous material and anomaly. Based on a sample of estimated local fibre directions, for each scanning window we compute several classification attributes, namely the coordinate wise means of local fibre directions, the entropy of the directional distribution, and a combination of them. We also propose a new spatial modification of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm. Besides the clustering we also consider testing the significance of anomalies. To this end, we apply a change point technique for random fields and derive the exact inequalities for tail probabilities of a test statistic. The proposed methodology is first validated on simulated images. Finally, it is applied to a 3D image of a fibre reinforced polymer.},

There have been a number of approximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this computational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer target the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte Carlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of (Bierkens, Roberts, 2017), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov process. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction (a property which is known to inhibit rapid convergence) the Zig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative which we observe to often have favourable convergence properties. We show how the Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an {\{}$\backslash$em exact approximate scheme{\}}, i.e. the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the variance of our unbiased estimator, then the Zig-Zag process can be super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the size of the data.},

abstract = {Recent analyses use geometric morphometrics (GM), the quantitative study of shape and its variation, to examine aspects of the archaeological record. Our research builds on such applications to examine the organization of production by applying GM analysis to whole ceramic vessels from the Casas Grandes culture of northwest Mexico. We quantify variation in vessel shape and size and conclude that specialists made at least some of the Ramos and Babicora Polychromes, but that the other Casas Grandes ceramic types were generally made by nonspecialists. This bolsters arguments for Medio period (AD 1200 to 1450) specialized production above the household level but indicates that specialized production was limited to a subset of economically valuable goods. We further suggest some Ramos Polychrome was made by attached specialists associated with elites at Paquime, the religious center of the Medio period, whereas some Babicora Polychrome was made by independent specialists. The analysis contributes to three important anthropological topics: (1) the study of the Medio period Casas Grandes culture, and by extension the organization of production in mid-level hierarchically organized societies; (2) geometric morphometric analysis of archaeological collections; and (3) the Standardization Hypothesis and the relationship between artifact standardization and the organization of production.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of selected models, methods, and challenges associated with the use of bilevel optimization in problems that involve consumers' demand response arising in the power sector. The main formulations and concepts of bilevel optimization are presented. The importance of demand response as a “dispatchable” resource in the evolution of power networks to smart grids is emphasized. The hierarchical nature of the interaction between decision-makers controlling different sets of variables in several problems involving demand response is highlighted, which establishes bilevel optimization as an adequate approach to decision support. The main concepts and solution approaches to those problems are underlined, in the context of the theoretical, methodological, and computational issues associated with bilevel optimization.},

It is based on integrating force contributions of all fibres crossing the crack plane. Piecewise linear models for the force contributions depending on fibre orientation and embedded length are fitted to force–slip curves obtained in single-fibre pull-out tests. Fibre characteristics in the crack are analysed in a micro-computed tomography image of a concrete sample. For more general predictions, a stochastic fibre model with a one-parametric orientation distribution is introduced. Simple estimators for the orientation parameter are presented, which only require fibre orientations in the crack plane. Our prediction method is calibrated to fit experimental tensile curves.},

Collaborative transportation offers opportunities to share capacities and thus reduce inefficiencies and environmental pollution considerably. It is therefore a highly relevant topic for both researchers and practitioners. We survey up-to-date literature in the field of shared resources in collaborative vehicle routing. We report that, in the last 3 years alone, more than 40 relevant articles were published. These studies can be classified according to the underlying level of information sharing. If a fully informed decision maker exists, we refer to this as centrally planned collaboration. In decentralized collaborations coalition partners agree on mechanisms, where no or only a limited amount of information has to be revealed. We elaborate on recent findings and identify topical research gaps for both centralized and decentralized collaborations.},

This book extends an earlier paper by the author [Advances in Appl. Probability 4 (1972), 508–541; MR0348819]. Topologies are constructed on the spaces of closed, open or compact subsets of a locally compact separable Hausdorff space which enable the assignment of probabilities to events such as the hitting or avoidance of a random set by a "structuring'' set. The concept of a random set presented is less general than the treatment of D. G. Kendall [Stochastic geometry (a tribute to the memory of Rollo Davidson), pp. 322–376, Wiley, London, 1974]. Alternating Choquet capacities of infinite order are shown to bear a relationship to random closed sets analogous to that between distribution functions and (real-valued) random variables. 
   Covariance functions, continuity in probability, weak stationarity and the existence of fixed points are discussed—these being concerned with the stochastic process determined by the indicator function of a random set. Concepts of almost sure continuity, infinite divisibility, stability and semi-Markovian property, similar in some respects to their counterparts in other areas of probability theory, are developed in a way which shows the increased scope of random set theory over a stochastic process viewpoint. 
   The fourth chapter provides a useful English reference for integral geometry, presenting some of the basic material from H. Hadwiger [Vorlesungen {\"{u}}ber Inhalt, Oberfl{\"{a}}che und Isoperimetrie, Chapter 6, Springer, Berlin, 1957; MR0102775; Russian translation, Izdat. "Nauka'', Moscow, 1966; MR0206822]. However, the chapter is not self-contained, there being frequent interplay between geometrical notions and the preceding random set theory. Almost sure convexity, tangential cones at the origin of covariance functions in Rd, random intercepts and projections are discussed in this section. 
   An alternative extension of the Minkowski functionals to finite unions of compact convex sets, based on a generalised Steiner formula, is presented for the first time in this book, unfortunately, in an ill-defined form. {\{}The application of (4–7–1) to obtain (4–7–7) is incorrect. However, the author has demonstrated (private communication) the existence of measures WkK which satisfy the first part of (4–7–7), namely 
∫(∑x′∈∏K(x,r)ϕ(x′))dx=∑k=0d(dk)rk∫WkK(dx)ϕ(x).
The proof proceeds by first considering a finite union K of compact convex sets Kk all of which are open with respect to a ball of radius $\epsilon$. A function $\Phi$i1,⋯,ik, equal almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue measure to Fi1,⋯,ik, but whose value at x depends only upon ∏Ki1∩⋯∩Kik(x) is then defined. Upon replacing F by $\Phi$, and noting that (4–7–1) is valid for integrable ϕ, (4–7–7) may be obtained. An approximation argument is invoked to deal with the general case.{\}} (The classical extension to the Minkowski functionals is obtained by extending additivity properties, and the author mentions yet another extension obtained by considering mean projections.) The Steiner-type extension is applied later to convexity number and densities of Minkowski functionals for random sets. 
   The main examples of random sets given are stationary, semi-Markov, infinitely divisible random closed sets which are characterised as unions of Poisson distributed cylinders with compact convex bases. Poisson networks of linear varieties are treated in detail, many results being due to R. E. Miles and others new. 
   An axiomatic approach brings the hazy experimental notions of grain size into mathematical perspective. Results applicable to the estimation of linear granulometries from experimental data are given. Motivated by these ideas, the chapters near the end of the book deal with various properties of set-valued maps. The final chapter shows that set-valued integrals and measures may be developed in analogy with their real-valued counterparts, making use of the simple properties of Minkowski set operations. No probabilistic interpretation is given. 
   The main achievement of the book is the presentation of a rigorous framework upon which to develop geometrical probability. Familiarity with basic topology and probability theory is assumed of the reader, but results from integral geometry are either derived or stated with references. Reviewed by Pamela Davy},

abstract = {In medical image analysis and high level computer vision, there is an intensive use of geometric features like orientations, lines, and geometric transformations ranging from simple ones (orientations, lines, rigid body or aﬃne transformations, etc.) to very complex ones like curves, surfaces, or general diﬀeomorphic transformations. The measurement of such geometric primitives is generally noisy in real applications and we need to use statistics either to reduce the uncertainty (estimation), to compare observations, or to test hypotheses. Unfortunately, even simple geometric primitives often belong to manifolds that are not vector spaces. In previous works [1, 2], we investigated invariance requirements to build some statistical tools on transfor- mation groups and homogeneous manifolds that avoids paradoxes. In this paper, we consider ﬁnite dimensional manifolds with a Riemannian metric as the basic structure. Based on this metric, we develop the notions of mean value and covariance matrix of a random element, normal law, Mahalanobis distance and $\backslash$($\backslash$chi{\^{}}2$\backslash$) law. We provide a new proof of the characterization of Riemannian centers of mass and an original gradient descent algorithm to eﬃciently compute them. The notion of Normal law we propose is based on the maximization of the entropy knowing the mean and covariance of the distribution. The resulting family of pdfs spans the whole range from uniform (on compact manifolds) to the point mass distribution. Moreover, we were able to provide tractable approximations (with their limits) for small variances which show that we can eﬀectively implement and work with these deﬁnitions.},

The key observation is that infinite-server queues having deterministic service times can easily be analyzed in terms of the arrival counting process. A variant of the same idea applies when the service times take values in a finite set, so this is the key assumption. In addition to new proofs of established results, the paper contains several new results, including limits for the work-in-system process, limits for steady-state distributions, limits for open networks with general customer routes, and rates of convergence. The relatively tractable Gaussian limits are promising approximations for many-server queues and open networks of such queues, possibly with finite waiting rooms.},

abstract = {This paper reports a study of scale-invariant Rayleigh Random Flights ("RRF'') in random environments given by planar Scale-Invariant Random Spatial Networks ("SIRS") based on speed-marked Poisson line processes. RRF can be viewed as producing "randomly broken {\$}\Pi{\$}-geodesics" on the SIRSN; the aim of the study is to shed some light on whether a (non-broken) {\$}\Pi{\$}-geodesic on a SIRSN might ever come to a complete stop en route. Suitable RRF with scale-invariant dynamics ("SIRSN-RRF"), are introduced via a theory of abstract scattering representations for Markov chains (which should be of independent interest). Palm conditioning (specifically the Mecke-Slivnyak theorem for Palm probabilities of Poisson point processes) and ideas from the ergodic theory of random walks in random environments are used to show that there exists a natural scale-invariant SIRSN-RRF whose speed neither diverges to infinity nor tends to zero. This supports the conjecture that (non-broken) geodesics in Poisson line SIRSN never come to a complete stop en route, which would imply that all such {\$}\Pi{\$}-geodesics can be represented as doubly-infinite sequences of connected line segments.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews:
The author continues his study of scale-invariant random spatial networks (SIRSNs), as introduced by D. J. Aldous and K. Ganesan [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110 (2013), no. 22, 8782–8785; MR3082274] and Aldous [Electron. J. Probab. 19 (2014), no. 15; MR3164768]. The particular model of interest is built from a marked Poisson line process on the plane R2 with intensity measure given by 
$\nu$(dvdrd$\theta$)=$\gamma$−12v−$\gamma$dvdrd$\theta$,
where r∈R is the signed distance of a line from the origin, $\theta$∈[0,$\pi$) is the angle made by the line and the x-axis, v∈(0,$\infty$) is a `speed-limit' for the line, and $\gamma${\textgreater}2 is a parameter. (Although not corresponding to a SIRSN, the borderline case $\gamma$=2 is also considered within the article.) 
   The focus of the present work is to define and explore basic properties of a natural, scale-invariant Rayleigh random flight (RRF) that has such a SIRSN as its state space. Roughly speaking, the process constructed starts by following a line in some direction at its maximum velocity, v say. On meeting a line of speed v′, it will switch to this with probability min{\{}1,(v′/v)$\alpha${\}}, where $\alpha$∈($\gamma$−1,$\infty$) is a parameter. That is, the process will always switch to a faster line, but to a slower line with a probability depending on how its speed relates to the current speed. On transferring to a new line, a direction is chosen uniformly at random. (NB: Taking $\alpha$ within the given range ensures a certain non-degeneracy of the process.) Following the rigorous introduction of the SIRSN-RRF, a stationary measure is found for the relative environment seen from the process at times when it changes lines. To quote from the introduction of the article, this consists of `the independent superposition of a unit-speed line along the x-axis with a line through [the origin] of 
(a)
a random log-speed given by a possibly asymmetric Laplace density; 
(b)
and a random angle ϕ with the unit-speed line (with ϕ having sine-weighted density); 
(c)
together with a copy of [the SIRSN].' 

   By checking that, when started from this stationary measure, the relative-environment process is ergodic, the author concludes that the SIRSN-RRF is `speed-neighbourhood-recurrent' at the critical value $\alpha$=2($\gamma$−1) (which is the unique value for which the measure described in part (a) above is symmetric). He describes the latter result as the main contribution of the paper and asserts that it is evidence in favour of the conjecture for planar SIRSNs that geodesics between two points never come to a complete halt (away from the endpoints). To complete the article, various interesting questions that point to directions for future research on the model are raised. Reviewed by David A. Croydon},

Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n 2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of Fr{\"{o}}hlich et al.

In lattice percolation, the most powerful of these methods consists of microcanonical simulations using the union-find algorithm to efficiently determine the connected clusters, and (in two dimensions) using exact values from conformal field theory for the probability, at the phase transition, that various kinds of wrapping clusters exist on the torus. We apply this approach to percolation in continuum models, finding overlaps between objects with real-valued positions and orientations. In particular, we find precise values of the percolation transition for disks, squares, rotated squares, and rotated sticks in two dimensions and confirm that these transitions behave as conformal field theory predicts.

We give two such results, one for random fixed-radius balls and the other for sequentially arriving randomly-centered and deterministically growing balls. Each is in fact a simple application of a different more general bound, the former concerning coverage by i.i.d. random sets with arbitrary distribution, and the latter concerning hitting times for Markov chains with a strong monotonicity property.

abstract = {Cities need to build on their resilience to deal with the combined effects of urbanization, changing geopolitical contexts, and climate change. The physical form of cities has significant implications for their capacity to deal with adverse events and changing conditions. This paper focuses on streets as major constituent elements of urban form. It offers a review of the theoretical discussions and empirical evidence on how design and con- figuration of urban streets and street networks can contribute to/detract from urban resilience. For the purpose of this study, measures related to urban streets are divided into two broad categories: network topology and design and orientation. Network topology is used to represent urban street network as a combination of nodes and links. Relationships between urban resilience and different centrality and connectivity measures related to network topology are discussed. The design and orientation category explores the possible effects of street width, street edges, street canyon geometry, and street layout and orientation on resilience of cities. It is discussed that all topology and design measures have implications for urban resilience. Appropriate physical form of urban streets can contribute to urban resilience by, among other things, ameliorating urban microclimate, reducing energy consumption and its associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing social capital, improving community health and well-being, and facilitating rapid and effective emergency response in the aftermath of disasters. Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streets and street networks.},

abstract = {In this work we introduce the discrete-space broken line process (with discrete and continues parameter values) and derive some of its properties. We explore polygonal Markov fields techniques developed by Arak-Surgailis. The discrete version is presented first and a natural continuum generalization to a continuous object living on the discrete lattice is then proposed and studied. The broken lines also resemble the Young diagram and the Hammersley process and are useful for computing last passage percolation values and finding maximal oriented paths. For a class of passage time distributions there is a family of boundary conditions that make the process stationary and self-dual. For such distributions there is a law of large numbers and the process extends to the infinite lattice. A proof of Burke's theorem emerges from the construction. We present a simple proof of the explicit law of large numbers for last passage percolation as an application. Finally we show that the exponential and geometric distributions are the only non-trivial ones that yield self-duality.},

Degree, betweenness, and PageRank centralities are selected as the analysis measures, and GPS-enabled taxi trajectory data is used to evaluate urban traffic flow. The results show that the mean value of the correlation coefficients between the modified degree, the betweenness, and the PageRank centralities and the traffic flow in all periods are higher than the mean value of the correlation coefficients between the conventional degree, the betweenness, the PageRank centralities and the traffic flow at different modes; this indicates that the modified measurements, for analyzing traffic flow, are superior to conventional centrality measurements. This study helps to shed light into the understanding of urban traffic flow in relation to different modes from the perspective of complex networks.},

A challenging feature is that these flows typically encounter singularities where the underlying graph structure changes. Our notion is robust enough to allow the flow to continue past these singularities. As a crucial tool for this purpose we study the heat flow on such singular time-dependent weighted graphs with changing graph structure. We then give several equivalent characterizations of super Ricci flows in terms of a discrete dynamic Bochner inequality, gradient and transport estimates for the heat flow, and dynamic convexity of the entropy along discrete optimal transport paths. The latter property can be used to show that our notion of super Ricci flow is consistent with classical super Ricci flows for manifolds (or metric measure spaces) in a discrete to continuum limit.},

abstract = {The paper concerns lattice triangulations, that is, triangulations of the integer points in a polygon in ℝ2$\backslash$mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}} whose vertices are also integer points. Lattice triangulations have been studied extensively both as geometric objects in their own right and by virtue of applications in algebraic geometry. Our focus is on random triangulations in which a triangulation $\sigma$$\backslash$sigma has weight $\lambda$|$\sigma$|$\backslash$lambda{\^{}}{\{}|$\backslash$sigma|{\}}, where $\lambda$$\backslash$lambda is a positive real parameter, and |$\sigma$||$\backslash$sigma| is the total length of the edges in $\sigma$$\backslash$sigma. Empirically, this model exhibits a “phase transition” at $\lambda$=1$\backslash$lambda=1 (corresponding to the uniform distribution): for $\lambda${\textless}1$\backslash$lambda{\textless}1 distant edges behave essentially independently, while for $\lambda${\textgreater}1$\backslash$lambda{\textgreater}1 very large regions of aligned edges appear. We substantiate this picture as follows. For $\lambda${\textless}1$\backslash$lambda{\textless}1 sufficiently small, we show that correlations between edges decay exponentially with distance (suitably defined), and also that the Glauber dynamics (a local Markov chain based on flipping edges) is rapidly mixing (in time polynomial in the number of edges in the triangulation). This dynamics has been proposed by several authors as an algorithm for generating random triangulations. By contrast, for $\lambda${\textgreater}1$\backslash$lambda{\textgreater}1 we show that the mixing time is exponential. These are apparently the first rigorous quantitative results on the structure and dynamics of random lattice triangulations.},

abstract = {Many biological systems use extensive networks for the transport of resources and information. Ants are no exception. How do biological systems achieve efficient transportation networks in the absence of centralized control and without global knowledge of the environment? Here, we address this question by studying the formation and properties of inter-nest transportation networks in the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We find that the formation of inter-nest networks depends on the number of ants involved in the construction process. When the number of ants is sufficient and networks do form, they tend to have short total length but a low level of robustness. These networks are topologically similar to either minimum spanning trees or Steiner networks. The process of network formation involves an initial construction of multiple links followed by a pruning process that reduces the number of trails. Our study thus illuminates the conditions under and the process by which minimal biological transport networks can be constructed.},

Recently it has found application in the derivation of surprising non-stochastic results concerning effective planar networks (Aldous and Kendall, 2008). The following is an account corresponding to three lectures on this material, including a very brief introduction to the relevant stochastic geometry, and also a description of some more recent work concerning flows in related networks (Kendall, 2008, 2011) as well as a rather curious random metric space.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
This is a survey paper covering topics on Poisson random lines, based on lectures given by the author in 2012. 
   The first section, after some background on Poisson processes in general, introduces and gives definitions of Poisson random line processes in the plane. The second section covers work by Aldous and Kendall on the connection between random lines and transportation networks, where Poisson line processes can be used to construct transportation networks with low total network length. Finally, the third section surveys the development of the ideas of the previous section as the Poissonian city: a random metric space where the points are in a disc and the distances between them come from a Poisson line process.

abstract = {{\{}Statistical network modeling has focused on representing the graph as a discrete structure, namely the adjacency matrix, and considering the exchangeability of this array. In such cases, the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem (Aldous, 1981;Hoover, 1979{\}} applies and informs us that the graph is necessarily either dense or empty. In this paper, we instead consider representing the graph as a measure on {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\_}+{\^{}}2{\$}. For the associated definition of exchangeability in this continuous space, we rely on the Kallenberg representation theorem (Kallenberg, 2005). We show that for certain choices of such exchangeable random measures underlying our graph construction, our network process is sparse with power-law degree distribution. In particular, we build on the framework of completely random measures (CRMs) and use the theory associated with such processes to derive important network properties, such as an urn representation for our analysis and network simulation. Our theoretical results are explored empirically and compared to common network models. We then present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution and demonstrate that we are able to recover graphs ranging from dense to sparse---and perform associated tests---based on our flexible CRM-based formulation. We explore network properties in a range of real datasets, including Facebook social circles, a political blogosphere, protein networks, citation networks, and world wide web networks, including networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges.},

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be ‘shorter' than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension d42, which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads. Studying the cellular structure of the areas enclosed by the roads, the distribution of cell sizes is scale invariant as well.},

Selection of paths: exhaustive (implicit path enumeration, structure allowing dynamic programming tricks) versus selective (heuristic behavioural rules).

Freight is harder to model than passenger traffic, as there is not just one deciding agent.

Ch5: "Traffic assignment models simulate the interaction of demand and supply on a trans- portation network. These models allow calculation of performance measures and user flows for each supply element (network link), resulting from origin–destination (O-D) demand flows, path choice behavior, and the mutual interactions between supply and demand."

On a qualitative level, intermittent random fields are distinguished by the appearance of sparsely distributed sharp "peaks" which give the main contribution to the formation of the statistical moments. The paper deals with the Cauchy problem (∂/∂t)u(t, x)=Hu(t, x), u(0, x)=t0(x) ≥ 0, (t, x) ∈ ℝ+ × ℤd, for the Anderson Hamiltonian H = $\kappa$$\Delta$ + $\xi$({\textperiodcentered}), $\xi$(x), x ∈ ℤd where is a (generally unbounded) spatially homogeneous random potential. This first part is devoted to some basic problems. Using percolation arguments, a complete answer to the question of existence and uniqueness for the Cauchy problem in the class of all nonnegative solutions is given in the case of i.i.d. random variables. Necessary and sufficient conditions for intermittency of the fields u(t,{\textperiodcentered}) as t→$\infty$ are found in spectral terms of H. Rough asymptotic formulas for the statistical moments and the almost sure behavior of u(t,x) as t→∞ are also derived. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This paper is centered on covariant dynamics on random graphs and random networks (marked graphs), which can be described as rules to navigate the vertices that are preserved by graph/network isomorphisms. Such dynamics are referred to as vertex-shifts here. Unimodular random networks can be heuristically described as networks seen from a vertex chosen uniformly at random, both in the finite and in infinite network cases. Some general ways of constructing unimodular random networks are reviewed together with instances of vertex-shifts. The main result of the paper is a classification of vertex-shifts on unimodular random networks. Each such vertex-shift partitions the vertices into a collection of connected components and foils, which correspond to the orbits and the stable manifold of the dynamics, respectively. The classification is based on the cardinality of the connected components and foils. It is shown that up to an event of zero probability, there are three types of foliations in a connected component: F/F (with finitely many finite foils), I/F (infinitely many finite foils), and I/I (infinitely many infinite foils). Distinctive properties of each type are also derived. An infinite connected component of the graph of a vertex-shift is a tree which, in the unimodular case, shares some similarities with a critical branching process. Such trees are referred to as Eternal Family Trees here. Construction techniques of such trees are also discussed. These lead to additional structural results on the graphs of vertex shifts in each case of the classification. The results are illustrated by concrete examples stemming from classical domains of probability theory: random graphs, branching processes and stationary point processes.},

We show that, for any constant dimension d and any set V of n points in ℝd, there exists a geometric graph with vertex set V that has O(n) edges and that has average stretch factor 1 + on(1). More precisely, the average stretch factor of this graph is 1 + O((log n/n)1/(2d+1)). We complement this upper bound with a lower bound: There exist n-point sets in ℝ2 for which any graph with O(n) edges has average stretch factor 1 + $\Omega$ (1/√n). Bounds of this type are not possible for the more commonly studied worst-case stretch factor. In particular, there exist point sets V such that any graph with worst-case stretch factor 1 {\_} on(1) has a superlinear number of edges.},

abstract = {In this article we explore how structural parameters of composites filled with one-dimensional, electrically conducting elements (such as sticks, needles, chains, or rods) affect the percolation properties of the system. To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of asymmetric two-dimensional stick systems with anisotropic alignments. We compute the percolation probability functions in the direction of preferential orientation of the percolating objects and in the orthogonal direction, as functions of the experimental structural parameters. Among these, we considered the average length of the sticks, the standard deviation of the length distribution, and the standard deviation of the angular distribution. We developed a computer algorithm capable of reproducing and verifying known theoretical results for isotropic networks and which allows us to go beyond and study anisotropic systems of experimental interest. Our research shows that the total electrical anisotropy, considered as a direct consequence of the percolation anisotropy, depends mainly on the standard deviation of the angular distribution and on the average length of the sticks. A conclusion of practical interest is that we find that there is a wide and well-defined range of values for the mentioned parameters for which it is possible to obtain reliable anisotropic percolation under relatively accessible experimental conditions when considering composites formed by dispersions of sticks, oriented in elastomeric matrices.},

abstract = {We study certain phase transitions of branching random walks (BRW) on Cayley graphs of free products. The aim of this paper is to compare the size and structural properties of the trace, i.e., the subgraph that consists of all edges and vertices that were visited by some particle, with those of the original Cayley graph. We investigate the phase when the growth parameter {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} is small enough such that the process survives but the trace is not the original graph. A first result is that the box-counting dimension of the boundary of the trace exists, is almost surely constant and equals the Hausdorff dimension which we denote by {\$}\backslashPhi(\backslashlambda){\$}. The main result states that the function {\$}\backslashPhi(\backslashlambda){\$} has only one point of discontinuity which is at {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}c{\}}=R{\$} where {\$}R{\$} is the radius of convergence of the Green function of the underlying random walk. Furthermore, {\$}\backslashPhi(R){\$} is bounded by one half the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the original Cayley graph and the behaviour of {\$}\backslashPhi(R)-\backslashPhi(\backslashlambda){\$} as {\$}\backslashlambda \backslashuparrow R{\$} is classified. In the case of free products of infinite groups the end-boundary can be decomposed into words of finite and words of infinite length. We prove the existence of a phase transition such that if {\$}\backslashlambda\backslashleq \backslashtilde\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}c{\}}{\$} the end boundary of the trace consists only of infinite words and if {\$}\backslashlambda{\textgreater}\backslashtilde\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}c{\}}{\$} it also contains finite words. In the last case, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of ends (of the trace and the original graph) induced by finite words is strictly smaller than the one of the ends induced by infinite words.},
annote = {A natural successor to the above work would be to study the behaviour of branching random walks on free products, and this is what is accomplished in Candellero's second paper. It is another substantial piece of work, published in the strong LMS family of journals. For branching random walk, a natural object of study is the so-called $\backslash$emph{\{}trace{\}}, simply described as the collection of sites visited by the branching random walk. It is intuitive that if branching occurs at a high enough rate then all sites will be visited. So suppose the rate is not high enough for this -- a phase transition then occurs. In this paper, estimates are given for the volume growth of the trace and for the box-counting cimension of the boundary. Proof techniques involve careful asymptotic analysis as before, but also branching process theory and some clever probabilistic constructions.},

Full proofs are used to illustrate mathematical concepts and each chapter includes a section that discusses applications of optimal transport to various areas, such as economics, finance, potential games, image processing and fluid dynamics. Several topics are covered that have never been previously in books on this subject, such as the Knothe transport, the properties of functionals on measures, the Dacorogna-Moser flow, the formulation through minimal flows with prescribed divergence formulation, the case of the supremal cost, and the most classical numerical methods. Graduate students and researchers in both pure and applied mathematics interested in the problems and applications of optimal transport will find this to be an invaluable resource.

abstract = {Studies of functional MRI data are increasingly
concerned with the estimation of dif- ferences in spatio-temporal
networks across groups of subjects or experimental conditions.
Unsupervised clustering and independent component analysis (ICA)
have been used to iden- tify such spatio-temporal networks. While
these approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at
the subject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental
conditions re- quire further methodological development. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by showing how self-organizing maps
(SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean inferential framework.
Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a Frechet mean
with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. The advantage of
this approach is twofold. Firstly, it allows the visualization of
the mean SOM in each experimental condition. Secondly, this
Frechean ap- proach permits one to draw inference on group
differences, using permutation of the group labels. We consider
the use of different distance functions, and introduce two
extensions of the classical sum of minimum distance (SMD) between
two SOMs, which take into account the spatio-temporal pattern of
the fMRI data. The validity of these methods is illustrated on
synthetic data. Through these simulations, we show that the three
distance functions of interest behave as expected, in the sense
that the ones capturing temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal
aspects of the SOMs are more likely to reach significance under
simulated scenarios characterized by temporal, spatial and
spatio-temporal differences, respectively. In addition, a
re-analysis of a classical experiment on visually-triggered
emotions demonstrates the usefulness of this methodology. In this
study, the multivariate functional patterns typi- cal of the
subjects exposed to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli are found to
be more similar than the ones of the subjects exposed to
emotionally neutral stimuli. In this re-analysis, the group-level
SOM output units with the smallest sample Jaccard indices were
compared with standard GLM group-specific z-score maps, and
provided considerable levels of agree- ment. Taken together, these
results indicate that our proposed methods can cast new light on
existing data by adopting a global analytical perspective on
functional MRI paradigms.},

Mikosch review: "{\{}About the first edition: To sum it up, one can perhaps see a distinction among advanced probability books into those which are original and path-breaking in content, such as Levy's and Doob's well-known examples, and those which aim primarily to assimilate known material, such as Loeve's and more recently Rogers and Williams'. Seen in this light, Kallenberg's present book would have to qualify as the assimilation of probability par excellence. It is a great edifice of material, clearly and ingeniously presented, without any non-mathematical distractions. Readers wishing to venture into it may do so with confidence that they are in very capable hands. - Mathematical Reviews This new edition contains four new chapters as well as numerous improvements throughout the text. There are new chapters on measure Theory-key results, ergodic properties of Markov processes and large deviations.{\}}"},

abstract = {The extent to which Anglo-Saxon society was capable of large-scale transformations of the landscape is hotly disputed. This interdisciplinary book – embracing archaeological and historical sources – explores this important period in our landscape history and the extent to which buildings, settlements and field systems were laid out using sophisticated surveying techniques. In particular, recent research has found new and unexpected evidence for the construction of building complexes and settlements on geometrically precise grids, suggesting a revival of the techniques of the Roman land-surveyors (Agrimensores). Two units of measurement appear to have been used: the ‘short perch' of 15 feet in central and eastern England, where most cases occur, and the ‘long perch' of 18 feet at the small number of examples identified in Wessex. This technically advanced planning is evident during two periods: c.600–800, when it may have been a mostly monastic practice, and c.940–1020, when it appears to have been revived in a monastic context but then spread to a wider range of lay settlements. Planning in the Early Medieval Landscape is a completely new perspective on how villages and other settlement were formed. It combines map and field evidence with manuscript treatises on land-surveying to show that the methods described in the treatises were not just theoretical, but were put into practice. In doing so it reveals a major aspect of previously unrecognised early medieval technology.},

abstract = {With smart grids replacing conventional power grids and rapidly expanding in both space and time, ensuring an acceptable system observability becomes a challenge in spatio-temporal expanding power grids. In addition, system operators face another challenge, namely, financial budget constraints. To address these challenges, a metering equipment allocation strategy for monitoring of the power grid state needs to be dynamic in both space and time. Unfortunately, existing metering allocation strategies are quite limited. They usually deal with static power grid topologies, and hence, do not reflect the spatio-temporal expansion of the power grid. In this paper, a spatio-temporal power grid model is proposed based on stochastic geometry, which we show that it is in a good match with real-world power grids. The proposed model enables us to carry out tractable dynamic allocation of metering equipment in a large (city-wide) and structurally evolving power grid. Using the developed model, a multi-year algorithm for the allocation of metering equipment is proposed based on finite horizon dynamic programming, given budgetary and technical constraints on system observability. Several case studies for metering allocation are demonstrated through simulation results.},

By defining the k-nearest-neighbour algorithm in this way we are able to extend the method to accommodate the original predictor variables as possible linear effects as well as allowing for the inclusion of multiple nearest-neighbour terms. The choice of the final model proceeds via a stepwise regression procedure. It is shown that our method incorporates a conventional generalised linear model and a conventional k-nearest-neighbour algorithm as special cases. Empirical results suggest that the method out-performs the standard k-nearest-neighbour method in terms of misclassification rate on a wide variety of datasets.},

Purely one-dimensional.

From AMS MR:
Let I be a countably infinite set of points in R which can be written as I={\{}ui: i∈Z{\}}, with ui{\textless}ui+1 for every i, where ui→±$\infty$ as i→±∞. Consider a continuous-time Markov chain Y={\{}Y(t): t≥0{\}} with state space I such that Y is driftless and Y jumps only between nearest neighbours. The convergence property of the Markov chain Y on the set I under suitable space-time scalings is investigated in this paper. A basic conclusion obtained is as follows. Let Y$\theta$(t):=$\theta$−1Y($\theta$2t) ($\theta${\textgreater}0) be the scaled version of the Markov chain Y and let $\mu$$\theta$ be the measure on R which assigns a mass mi/$\theta$ to the point ui/$\theta$, where mi=(ui+1−ui−1)/(2∑j≠iqij(uj−ui)2), with qij the (i,j) element of the Q-matrix of Y. If $\mu$$\theta$ converges to the Lebesgue measure, then the law of Y$\theta$ converges weakly to the law of standard Brownian motion. In the latter part of the paper the authors wisely apply this conclusion to some cases when the set I consists of the points of a renewal process and the jump rates assigned to each state in I are perhaps randomly chosen, and some further interesting results are thus obtained.

abstract = {Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and the Brownian map (TBM) are two distinct models of measure-endowed random surfaces. LQG is defined in terms of a real parameter {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}, and it has long been believed that when {\$}\backslashgamma = \backslashsqrt{\{}8/3{\}}{\$}, the LQG sphere should be equivalent (in some sense) to TBM. However, the LQG sphere comes equipped with a conformal structure, and TBM comes equipped with a metric space structure, and endowing either one with the other's structure has been an open problem for some time. This paper is the first in a three-part series that unifies LQG and TBM by endowing each object with the other's structure and showing that the resulting laws agree. The present work uses a form of the quantum Loewner evolution (QLE) to construct a metric on a dense subset of a {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}8/3{\}}{\$}-LQG sphere and to establish certain facts about the law of this metric, which are in agreement with similar facts known for TBM. The subsequent papers will show that this metric extends uniquely and continuously to the entire {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}8/3{\}}{\$}-LQG surface and that the resulting measure-endowed metric space is TBM.},

The proposed models, the Whittle-Mat$\backslash$'ern fields, are defined via a fractional stochastic partial differential equation on the compact metric graph and are a natural extension of Gaussian fields with Mat$\backslash$'ern covariance functions on Euclidean domains to the non-Euclidean metric graph setting. Existence of the processes, as well as their sample path regularity properties are derived. The model class in particular contains differentiable Gaussian processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a valid differentiable Gaussian field on general compact metric graphs. We then focus on a model subclass which we show contains processes with Markov properties. For this case, we show how to evaluate finite dimensional distributions of the process exactly and computationally efficiently. This facilitates using the proposed models for statistical inference without the need for any approximations. Finally, we derive some of the main statistical properties of the model class, such as consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters and asymptotic optimality properties of linear prediction based on the model with misspecified parameters.},

Monogr., 69, Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1987; MR0879119]. As the authors write in the preface, this edition has to be considered as a "modernization'' of the previous one. Indeed, stochastic geometry finds application in many research fields (among them: materials sciences, biology, medicine, environmental sciences) in which new ideas, results and methods have been developed in the last two decades. More than 700 new references are listed in the bibliography in this new edition. 
   This book will certainly be useful both to the expert and to the beginner in stochastic geometry and spatial statistics looking for a reference text on the subject. The reader interested in learning more about both mathematical proofs and further applications of the results which are only cited or mentioned will find accurate references here. 
   As in the previous editions, the authors succeed in bringing together both the mathematical foundations necessary for a rigorous exposition of the subjects treated, and their statistical or computational aspects. The exposition is such that the reader is led from the simple to the more complicated; this is evident also from the order chosen to present the contents. Indeed, after an introductory chapter on mathematical foundations, the authors first introduce the Poisson point process (Chapter 2) and the Boolean model (Chapter 3), which are the simplest and most studied point process and random closed set, respectively, and then they pass to the general theory (Chapters 4–7). An entire chapter (Chapter 8) is devoted to the study of systems of fibres and systems of surfaces randomly distributed on the plane or in space, while Chapter 9 deals with random tessellations and related topics. In both chapters the interest is focused on general results in the cases of stationarity or motion invariance. The last chapter is devoted to stereology, as part of the applications of stochastic geometry and spatial statistics. Reviewed by Elena Villa},

Current statistical models of hurricane activity are focused on the frequency of events over the entire North Atlantic basin. The exception is the lead author's previous work, which models the occurrence of hurricanes over the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the southeast U.S. coast separately. Here the authors use statistics to analyze data from historical and paleoclimatic records to expand this work. In particular, an inverse correlation in major hurricane activity across latitudes at various timescales is articulated. When activity is above normal at high latitudes it tends to be below normal at low latitudes and vice versa. Past research, paleoclimatic records, and historical data hint at the potential of using the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) as an indicator of where storms will likely track over long timescales.

In expert systems it is common to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},

This paper considers random walks on spatial graphs generated by point processes in Rd. The graphs considered are the Delaunay triangulation, the Gabriel graph and the skeleton of the Voronoi tiling, while the results apply to point processes satisfying a number of conditions but including homogeneous Poisson point processes, Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster and hardcore processes, and, for recurrence only, determinantal point processes.
The full results allow conductances on the edges which may depend on the graph structure. In two dimensions, it is shown that as long as the conductances are bounded above, for almost all realisations of the point process the random walk is recurrent. Similarly, in three dimensions it is shown that as long as the conductances are bounded below or are a decreasing positive function of the edge lengths, then for almost all realisations of the point process the random walk is transient.
The proofs work via electrical network–based methods. For recurrence, a criterion similar to the Nash-Williams criterion for recurrence is developed, and it is shown that the graphs of interest almost surely satisfy this criterion. For transience, a criterion is developed for there to be a rough embedding of an infinite percolation cluster to the graph of interest. It is shown that the graphs of interest on homogeneous Poisson point processes and Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster and hardcore processes satisfy this criterion. Then the transience of infinite percolation clusters gives the result.

abstract = {Consider an improper Poisson line process, marked by positive speeds so as to satisfy a scale-invariance property (actually, scale-equivariance). The line process can be characterized by its intensity measure, which belongs to a one-parameter family if scale and Euclidean invariance are required. This paper investigates a proposal by Aldous, namely that the line process could be used to produce a scale-invariant random spatial network (SIRSN) by means of connecting up points using paths which follow segments from the line process at the stipulated speeds. It is shown that this does indeed produce a scaleinvariant network, under suitable conditions on the parameter; in fact, it then produces a parameter-dependent random geodesic metric for d-dimensional space (d ≥ 2), where geodesics are given by minimum-time paths. Moreover, in the planar case, it is shown that the resulting geodesic metric space has an almost everywhere unique-geodesic property that geodesics are locally of finite mean length, and that if an independent Poisson point process is connected up by such geodesics then the resulting network places finite length in each compact region. It is an open question whether the result is a SIRSN (in Aldous' sense; so placing finite mean length in each compact region), but it may be called a pre-SIRSN.},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
The emergence of very large-scale spatial networks, such as those used by Google Maps and Bing Maps, has prompted the development of mathematical models possessing various natural statistical invariances under translation, rotation, and scaling. The core structure of scale-invariant random spatial networks (SIRSN) was elicited in a definition by David Aldous (2014), together with a proposal for a stochastic geometric construction via Poisson line processes. In the paper under review, the author effectively exploits a point-line duality analysis of this construction and verifies that it satisfies the first four of six conditions for an SIRSN in two dimensions, referred to as a pre-SIRSN. In higher dimensions the first two conditions, namely those for a random metric space, are verified. The questions in two dimensions pertaining to an additional fifth property defining a weak SIRSN, and the fifth and sixth defining a full SIRSN, are left open. The paper is concluded with basic open questions, together with some intriguing connections to Brownian maps and, perhaps, Liouville Brownian motions. Reviewed by Edward C. Waymire},

abstract = {We consider simple random walks on Delaunay triangulations generated by point processes in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}. Under suitable assumptions on the point processes, we show that the random walk satisfies an almost sure (or quenched) invariance principle. This invariance principle holds for point processes which have clustering or repulsiveness properties including Poisson point processes, Mat{\{}$\backslash$'e{\}}rn cluster and Mat{\{}$\backslash$'e{\}}rn hardcore processes. The method relies on the decomposition of the process into a martingale part and a corrector which is proved to be negligible at the diffusive scale.},
annote = {From AMS MR:
The Delaunay triangulation of a point process $\xi$ is the dual graph of the associated Voronoi tiling. In this article, conditions on a simple, stationary, isotropic point process are given under which the variable speed random walk on the Delaunay triangulation—that is, the Markov chain that has a unit transition rate along each edge of the graph—satisfies a quenched invariance principle, i.e. for almost-realisation of the point process, the random walk converges to Brownian motion under the usual diffusive scaling (a similar result is also noted for the discrete-time simple random walk). More specifically, the conditions on the point process are as follows: (V) only small boxes not hit by $\xi$; (SD) stochastic domination of the collection of `good boxes', where the number of points in $\xi$ is well behaved, by a Bernoulli site percolation process; (Er) ergodicity of $\xi$ under translations; and (PM) polynomial moments for certain quantities, such as the number of points of $\xi$ in a unit volume. Alternative conditions are also provided, and it is also noted that they are readily checked for homogeneous Poisson processes, Mat{\'{e}}rn cluster processes, and Mat{\'{e}}rn hardcore processes. The proof is based on the now standard approach for proving quenched invariance principles involving the construction of a (sub-linear) harmonic corrector, which enables the result to be obtained from a classical invariance principle for martingales.

abstract = {Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90{\%}, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the lottery ticket hypothesis: dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (winning tickets) that-when trained in isolation-reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20{\%} of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

abstract = {For independent translation-invariant irreducible percolation models, it is proved that the infinite cluster, when it exists, must be unique. The proof is based on the convexity (or almost convexity) and differentiability of the mean number of clusters per site, which is the percolation analogue of the free energy. The analysis applies to both site and bond models in arbitrary dimension, including long range bond percolation. In particular, uniqueness is valid at the critical point of one-dimensional 1/∣x−y∣2 models in spite of the discontinuity of the percolation density there. Corollaries of uniqueness and its proof are continuity of the connectivity functions and (except possibly at the critical point) of the percolation density. Related to differentiability of the free energy are inequalities which bound the “specific heat” critical exponent $\alpha$ in terms of the mean cluster size exponent $\gamma$ and the critical cluster size distribution exponent $\delta$; e.g., 1+$\alpha$≦$\gamma$ ($\delta$/2−1)/($\delta$−1).},

abstract = {How do pedestrians choose their paths within city street networks? Human path planning has been extensively studied at the aggregate level of mobility flows, and at the individual level with strictly designed behavioural experiments. However, a comprehensive, individual-level model of how humans select pedestrian paths in real urban environments is still lacking. Here, we analyze human path planning behaviour in a large dataset of individual pedestrians, whose GPS traces were continuously recorded as they pursued their daily goals. Through statistical analysis we reveal two robust empirical discoveries, namely that (1) people increasingly deviate from the shortest path as the distance between origin and destination increases, and (2) individual choices exhibit direction-dependent asymmetries when origin and destination are swapped. In order to address the above findings, which cannot be explained by existing models, we develop a vector-based navigation framework motivated by the neural evidence of direction-encoding cells in hippocampal brain networks, and by behavioural evidence of vector navigation in animals. Modelling pedestrian path preferences by vector-based navigation increases the model's predictive power by 35{\%}, compared to a model based on minimizing distance with stochastic effects. We show that these empirical findings and modelling results generalise across two major US cities with drastically different street networks, suggesting that vector-based navigation is a universal property of human path planning, independent of specific city environments. Our results offer a simple, unified explanation of numerous findings about human navigation, and posit a computational mechanism that may underlie the human capacity to efficiently navigate in environments at various scales.},

A question currently under consideration in this field is whether any evidence exists that buildings in settlements dated to the early Medieval period may have been planned according to a perpendicular grid system. Assessment of the features of a site of interest, and any spatial or angular patterns contained therein, has until now typically been carried out by visual appraisal of transcribed site plans. We propose a method by which a JPEG image of an archaeological site of interest may be converted into a set of points representing the locations of post-holes that once formed part of the support of large structures such as walls, buildings and fences. Defining the orientation of the post-holes by the direction in which its nearest neighbour lies, we are able to test objectively whether there is any evidence that larger features share a common orientation, and to assess whether a similar grid orientation is shared globally across multiple regions of the grid, or found only locally in smaller regions.},

Key properties of the graphs in this context turn out to be amenability and nonamenability. The same problem is considered for certain dependent percolation models – most prominently the Fortuin–Kasteleyn random-cluster model – and in situations where the standard connectivity notion is replaced by entanglement or rigidity. So-called simultaneous uniqueness in couplings of percolation processes is also considered. Some of the main results are proved in detail, while for others the proofs are merely sketched, and for yet others they are omitted. Several open problems are discussed.},

abstract = {The success of lottery ticket initializations (Frankle and Carbin, 2019) suggests that small, sparsified networks can be trained so long as the network is initialized appropriately. Unfortunately, finding these "winning ticket" initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets.

abstract = {We study uniform spanning forest measures on infinite graphs. which are weak limits of uniform spanning tree measures from finite subgraphs. These limits can be taken with free (FSF) or wired (WSF) boundary conditions. Pemantle proved that the free and wired spanning forests coincide in Z(d) and that they give a single tree iff d less than or equal to 4.In the present work, we extend Pemantle's alternative to general graphs and exhibit further connections of uniform spanning forests to random walks, potential theory, invariant percolation and amenability. The uniform spanning forest model is related to random cluster models in statistical physics, but, because of the preceding connections, its analysis can be carried further. Among our results are the following:The FSF and WSF in a graph G coincide iff all harmonic Dirichlet functions on G are constant.The tail sigma -fields of the WSF and the FSF are trivial on any graph.On any Cayley graph that is not a finite extension of Z, all component trees of the WSF have one end; this is new in Z(d) for d greater than or equal to 5.On any tree, as well as on any graph with spectral radius less than 1, a.s. all components of the WSF are recurrent.The basic topology of the free and the wired uniform spanning forest measures on lattices in hyperbolic space H-d is analyzed.A Cayley graph is amenable iff for all epsilon {\textgreater} 0, the union of the WSF and Bernoulli percolation with parameter E is connected.Harmonic measure from infinity is shown to exist on any recurrent proper planar graph with finite codegrees.We also present numerous open problems and conjectures.},

@book{Hardy-1908,
abstract = {The book was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge and in schools preparing to study higher mathematics. It was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students — the top 10{\%} to 20{\%} by ability. Hardy himself did not originally find a passion for mathematics only seeing it as a way to beat the other students, which he did decisively, and gain scholarships. However, his book excels in effectively explaining analytical number theory and calculus following the rigor of mathematics. Whilst his book changed the way the subject was taught at university, the content reflects the era in which the book was written. The whole book explores number theory and the author constructs real numbers theoretically. It adequately deals with single-variable calculus, sequences, number series, properties of cos, sin, log, etc. but does not refer to mathematical groups, multi-variable functions or vector calculus. Each section includes some demanding problems. Hardy combines the enthusiasm of the missionary with the rigor of the purist in his exposition of the fundamental ideas of the differential and integral calculus, of the properties of infinite series and of other topics involving the notion of limit. Hardy's presentation of mathematical analysis is as valid today as when first written: students will find that his economical and energetic style of presentation is one that modern authors rarely come close to. Despite its limitations, it is considered a classic in its field. It is probably of most use to 1st year university students of pure mathematics.},

To address this question, we propose a new nonparametric test of association between a time series of images and a series of binary event labels. We ask whether there is a difference in distribution between (dependent but identically distributed) 24-h sequences of images preceding an event versus a non-event. By rewriting the statistical test as a regression problem, we leverage neural networks to infer modes of structural evolution of TC convection that are representative of the lead-up to rapid intensity change events. Dependencies between nearby sequences are handled by a bootstrap procedure that estimates the marginal distribution of the label series. We prove that type I error control is guaranteed as long as the distribution of the label series is well-estimated, which is made easier by the extensive historical data for binary TC event labels. We show empirical evidence that our proposed method identifies archetypes of infrared imagery associated with elevated rapid intensification risk, typically marked by deep or deepening core convection over time. Such results provide a foundation for improved forecasts of rapid intensification.},

In some applications data sets consist of spatial point patterns clustered along or around a latent system of fibres or curves. The authors give several examples and investigate two real data sets in more detail (earthquake epicenters clustered around seismic faults and sweat pores in fingerprints along the ridges). A new approach to analyzing these data is introduced. To each point in the observation window an undirected orientation is assigned. In such a way, a family of fibres is described by an orientation field. In order to estimate this field from the data, an empirical Bayes approach is utilized. Sampling from the posterior distribution of the fibres is accomplished by the birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Reviewed by Zbyn{\v{e}}k Pawlas},

abstract = {Maximal couplings are (probabilistic) couplings of Markov processes such that the tail probabilities of the coupling time attain the total variation lower bound (Aldous bound) uniformly for all time. Markovian (or immersion) couplings are couplings defined by strategies where neither process is allowed to look into the future of the other before making the next transition. Markovian couplings are typically easier to construct and analyze than general couplings, and play an important role in many branches of probability and analysis. Hsu and Sturm (2013) proved that the reflection-coupling of Brownian motion is the unique Markovian maximal coupling (MMC) of Brownian motions starting from two different points. Later, Kuwada (2009) proved that the existence of a MMC for Brownian motions on a Riemannian manifold enforces existence of a reflection structure on the manifold. In this work, we investigate suitably regular elliptic diffusions on manifolds, and show how consideration of the diffusion geometry (including dimension of the isometry group and flows of isometries) is fundamental in classification of the space and the generator of the diffusion for which an MMC exists, especially when the MMC also holds under local perturbations of the starting points for the coupled diffusions. We also describe such diffusions in terms of Killing vectorfields (generators of isometry groups) and dilation vectorfields (generators of scaling symmetry groups).},
annote = {From Mathematical Reviews
The authors study the Markovian maximal couplings of elliptic diffusion processes on manifolds and show that the existence of such a coupling implies strong conditions on the space and the generator of the process. The paper begins with an introduction and some history on the subject. A coupling of two processes on the same state space, starting at two different points, is a joint distribution such that with a nonzero probability, the two processes will meet and then stick together. The Aldous inequality states: 
P($\tau${\textgreater}t)≥∥$\mu$1,t−$\mu$2,t∥TV,
that is, the tail probability of the coupling time $\tau$ is bounded below by the total variation norm of the difference between the distributions of the two processes at time t. The coupling is called maximal if the equality is attained for all t{\textgreater}0. A coupling of two Markov processes is called Markovian if the joint process is also Markovian. An interesting example of a Markovian maximal coupling (MMC) is the reflection coupling of two copies of Brownian motion in a Euclidean space, in which the second process is obtained by reflecting the first one on the hyperplane bisecting the two initial points until it reaches the hyperplane. It was shown in [E. P. Hsu and K.-T. Sturm, Commun. Math. Stat. 1 (2013), no. 1, 93–104; MR3197874] that the reflection coupling is the unique MMC for Euclidean Brownian motion. The MMC of Brownian motions on Riemannian manifolds, in connection with reflection, was investigated in [K. Kuwada, Electron. J. Probab. 14 (2009), no. 25, 633–662; MR2486817]. 
   The aim of the present paper is to develop the results in [K. Kuwada, op. cit.] to the case of a general elliptic diffusion process on a manifold M with smooth coefficients, under certain regularity conditions. Such a diffusion process may be regarded as a Brownian motion plus a drift under a suitable Riemannian structure on M. It is shown that the existence of the MMC for any two initial points near two fixed points imposes some rather strong conditions on the space M and the drift term. More precisely, M has to be one of three basic space forms: a Euclidean space, a hypersphere or a hyperbolic space. Moreover, the drift can only be an infinitesimal isometry (and a dilation in the Euclidean case). The time-dependent drifts are also considered on Euclidean spaces. Reviewed by Ming Liao},

In fact, studying the shape of a trajectory means studying how the deformation changes along each path irrespectively of the actual shape to which these deformations apply. The independence of the deformation from the shape to which it is applied is critical: it implies that any shape variation between individuals at the beginning of each trajectories must be completely filtered out. A Parallel Transport, that can be based on various connection types, is necessary to perform such kind of shape data centering. The Levi Civita connection can also be used to transport a deformation. We demonstrate that this procedure does not preserve deformation even in the ane case. We propose a novel procedure called Direct Transport able to perfectly transport deformation in the ane case and to better approximate non ane deformation in comparison to existing tools.},

abstract = {We consider spatial stochastic models, which can be applied e.g. to telecommunication networks with two hierarchy levels. In particular, we consider two Cox processes concentrated on the edge set of a random tessellation, where the points can describe the locations of low-level and high-level network components, respectively, and the edge set the underlying infrastructure of the network, like road systems, railways, etc. Furthermore, each low-level component is marked with the shortest path along the edge set to the nearest high-level component. We investigate the typical shortest path length of the resulting marked point process, which is an important characteristic e.g. in performance analysis and planning of telecommunication networks. In particular, we show that its distribution converges to simple parametric limit distributions if a certain scaling factor converges to zero and infinity, respectively. This can be used to approximate the density of the typical shortest path length by analytical formulae.},

abstract = {The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a Fourier-related transform widely used in signal processing and well suited to the analysis of open outlines. This method was applied here to evaluate the discrimination power of the inner lateral rib for two palstave populations dating from the Middle Bronze Age, excavated in northwest France. A corpus of almost 400 palstaves (bronze axes) of the Breton and Norman types was processed, and compared to specimens found at Sermizelles in Burgundy. The procedure is robust and produces a discrimination in good agreement with the traditional typology. Besides the definition of a 'standard' shape for each population, the morphometrical approach allows shape disparity, which is generally inaccessible to the naked eye, to be visualised and quantified. Shape disparity indicates that, contrary to previous assumptions, the bronze axes from the Sermizelles hoards cannot be explained as an assortment of Breton and Norman palstaves alone. We believe that this approach is quick, reproducible, and generalisable enough to be applied to a wide variety of artefacts from different periods, in order to clarify their typology and even their origin. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Endow this tree with the graph distance renormalized by n1/3 and with the uniform measure on its vertices. We show that the resulting space converges in distribution as n→$\infty$to a random compact measured metric space in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology.We additionally show that the limit is a random binary ℝ-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling between the MST problem and the Erdo[double acute]s-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph. We exploit the explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erdo[double acute]s-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph in the so-called critical window, established in [Probab. Theory Related Fields 152 (2012) 367-406], and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a "critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST. In order to accomplish this, we introduce the notion of ℝ-graphs, which generalise ℝ-trees, and are of independent interest.},

CLT is related to the family of Travelling Salesman Problems with Profits, but differs by defining the weight function on edges instead of vertices, and by requiring the total weight to be within a range instead of being at least some quota. We prove CLT is {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}NP{\}}{\$}-hard, even in the simple case when the input graph is a path. We derive an informative lower bound by relaxing the integrality of edges and propose a heuristic motivated by this relaxation. For the case that requires the tour to be a simple cycle, we develop two heuristics which exploit Suurballe's algorithm to find low-cost, weight-feasible cycles. We demonstrate our algorithms by addressing a real-world problem that affects urban populations: finding routes that minimise air pollution exposure for walking, running and cycling in the city of London.},

The model exploits the Abelian group structure inherited from either of the log-Cholesky and log-Euclidean frameworks for symmetric positive-definite matrices and naturally extends to general Abelian Lie groups. The proposed additive model is shown to connect to an additive model on a tangent space. This connection not only entails an efficient algorithm to estimate the component functions, but also allows one to generalize the proposed additive model to general Riemannian manifolds. Optimal asymptotic convergence rates and normality of the estimated component functions are established, and numerical studies show that the proposed model enjoys good numerical performance, and is not subject to the curse of dimensionality when there are multiple predictors. The practical merits of the proposed model are demonstrated through an analysis of brain diffusion tensor imaging data.},

abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation. Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

@article{Tsiotas-2021,
abstract = {Network science has provided new ways and effective methods in the modeling of communication systems. According to this discipline, systems of economic and spatial interaction are considered as spatial networks and are modeled into graphs. This approach allows studying transportation networks and other spatial networks of national and global economic importance in terms of graph theory and statistical mechanics and it can provide new insights for the structure and functionality of these systems, which are not visible through the prism of spatial and economic analysis. Within this context, this paper models the interregional road transportation network in Greece (GRN), a spatial network of prime economic importance for its country, into a geo-referenced primal graph and it discusses its geographical and topological features under the regional economics' perspec­ tive. The results show that GRN has a mesh (lattice-like) structure subjected to spatial constraints and that it is ruled by primary developmental dynamics, where many aspects of network topology are related to economic aspects of the road network. Overall, the paper highlights that measures of network topology are related to different aspects of the network's socio-economic framework and thus they can be considered as indicators of economic performance for this transportation network.},

centers. The well-known Voronoi tessellation partitions $\backslash$(R{\^{}}d$\backslash$) into
polyhedral regions (of varying volumes) by allocating each site of
$\backslash$(R{\^{}}d$\backslash$) to the closest center. Here we study allocations of $\backslash$(R{\^{}}d$\backslash$)
to $\backslash$($\Xi$$\backslash$) in which each center attempts to claim a region of equal
volume $\backslash$($\alpha$$\backslash$).

We focus on the case where $\backslash$($\Xi$$\backslash$) arises from a Poisson process of
unit intensity. It was proved in $\backslash$texttt{\{}math.PR/0505668{\}} that there
is a unique allocation which is stable in the sense of the Gale-Shapley
marriage problem. We study the distance X from a typical site to
its allocated center in the stable allocation.

The model exhibits a phase transition in the appetite $\backslash$($\alpha$$\backslash$).
In the critical case $\backslash$($\alpha$=1$\backslash$) we prove a power law upper bound
on $\backslash$(X$\backslash$) in dimension $\backslash$(d=1$\backslash$). It is an open problem to prove any
upper bound in $\backslash$(d$\backslash$geq 2$\backslash$). (Power law lower bounds were proved in

Via a case study from Bronze Age Crete, we extend the analytical range of this model by suggesting ways in which it can (a) remain effective in the presence of missing data, (b) be given a stronger grounding in the physical landscape, and/or (c) be used to consider the evolutionary trajectory of settlements and physical routes over time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is closely related to the peeling process, the hull process, and the Brownian cactus. Using these ideas, we prove that the Brownian map is the only random sphere-homeomorphic metric measure space with certain properties: namely, scale invariance and the conditional independence of the inside and outside of certain "slices" bounded by geodesics. We also formulate a characterization in terms of the so-called L$\backslash$'evy net produced by a metric exploration from one measure-typical point to another.

The material is complete and detailed enough to be used for self-study; it can also serve as a reference work for professional mathematicians working in other areas. The books utility for such a varied readership is enhanced by a diagram showing the interdependence of the separate chapters so that individual chapters and the material they depend upon can be selected, while others can be skipped.The book incorporates many of the most significant discoveries and pioneering contributions of the masters of the subject: Borel, Cartan, Chevalley, Iwasawa, Mostow, Siegel, and Weyl, among others.},

Theoretically, these two distance concepts imply quite different assumptions. Analytically, they produce also different results. In this paper we assess the differences between these two network distance concepts, using a model of the UK's complete road network (2,031,971 nodes) and a very large dataset of vehicular movement counts (20,752 locations). We describe the statistical associations between observed vehicular flows and the betweenness centrality of the road-network nodes where such flows were measured, the latter calculated with metric and angular distance functions, across a number of increasing radii. Relations to road capacity are also discussed in principal roads where this is known. The geographical comprehensiveness of our model and the size of our movement sample allow us to state, with unprecedented statistical validity, the clear outperformance of angular distance over metric distance, in what concerns the strength of the studied correlations. This is true for all types of roads (urban and non- urban) and for all motorized vehicles, representing 99.05{\%} of the total traffic; the remaining 0.95{\%} correspond to pedal cycles, which yielded inconclusive results. We also demonstrate the existence of two distinct regimes of association between movement and centrality, conspicuous in cities but altogether absent in non-urban areas, which represent new evidence supporting space syntax's dual model of urban form.},

This random graph is studied through a novel subgraph, called a bridge graph, generated by paths started in a fixed state at any time. The bridge graph is made into a unimodular network by marking it and selecting a root in a specified fashion. The unimodularity of this network is leveraged to discern global properties of the larger Doeblin graph. Bi-recurrence, i.e., recurrence both forwards and backwards in time, is introduced and shown to be a key property in uniquely distinguishing paths in the Doeblin graph, and also a decisive property for Markov chains indexed by Z. Properties related to simulating the bridge graph are also studied.},

We prove that weak limit points of any trajectory of translation-invariant measures, satisfying a non-nullness condition, are Gibbs states for the same specification as the time-stationary measure. This is done under the additional assumption that zero entropy loss of the limiting measure w.r.t. the time-stationary measure implies that they are Gibbs measures for the same specification. We show how to prove the non-nullness for a large number of cases, and also give an alternate version of the last condition such that the non-nullness requirement can be dropped. As an application we obtain the attractor property if there is a reversible Gibbs measure. Our method generalizes convergence results using relative entropy techniques to a large class of dynamics including irreversible and non-ergodic ones.},

Every mathematician with some knowledge of stochastic processes is aware of the interest and importance of the Poisson process. Its description is usually found in books on stochastic processes or point processes, but typically scattered through several different chapters. Therefore it is very useful to have now a book which is devoted to a systematic treatment of Poisson processes. The book under review fulfills the expectations one might have when a famous elder author writes a book on a classic topic. It gives the basic facts in a clear and lucid way. It is shown how the theory can be applied to interesting problems of astronomy, queueing and traffic, etc., and these examples are studied very thoroughly and deeply, giving even the specialist new insights. Thus, the book is an excellent basis for lectures or seminars; the reviewer also believes that this book can be a valuable gift for a young mathematician to stimulate his or her interest in stochastic processes and in applied probability in general. 
   The chapter headings follow: 1. Stochastic models for random sets of points, 2. Poisson processes in general spaces, 3. Sums over Poisson processes, 4. Poisson processes on the line, 5. Marked Poisson processes, 6. Cox processes, 7. Stochastic geometry, 8. Completely random measures, 9. The Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. 
   It can be seen that this book presents nearly all the material one might expect (if statistics is excluded). It is important that the multidimensional process be considered as well as the one-dimensional one. Nevertheless, the reviewer wonders why the author does not discuss the simulation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson processes. Furthermore, the term "thinning'' deserves more explicit discussion. Its application to the derivation of the formula for the capacity functional of the Boolean model (of the theory of random closed sets) would then be a further example in Chapter 7.

Also, we mention important extensions and generalizations of this theory that have emerged ever since and discuss a whole family of applications, ranging from finance, through the Kolmogorov-Obukhov model of turbulence to 2d-Liouville quantum gravity.

abstract = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the size of smart grid are witnessing rapid expansion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.},

abstract = {We consider the power and rate allocation for a transmission in a wireless network where the transmitter knows the channel state of the desired receiver but only knows the statistics of the interferes. While this scenario is often encountered in practice, and extremely important in dense networks, its optimal solution was not yet known. The analysis considers nodes that are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process, and hence applies both to cellular and to ad-hoc networks. We derive (for the first time) the optimal power allocation at a node, based only on the channel gain to its desired receiver. We also derive the optimal rate allocation in networks that are characterized by the outage rate model. Considering sub-optimal allocations, we advocate the use of the simple threshold scheduling scheme for power allocation and linear rate adaptation for rate allocation. We prove that these suboptimal schemes are close to optimal, for any channel fading. We also present simulation results over Rayleigh fading channels that show a maximum loss of 1.5{\%} between the advocated schemes and the optimal schemes.},

annote = {From Mathematical Reviews:
This paper is the seventh chapter in Kanti Mardia's Festschrift [Geometry driven statistics, Wiley Ser. Probab. Stat., Wiley, Chichester, 2015; MR3470148]. The work stems from an `intellectual curiosity' as to whether two hurricanes that occur consecutively exhibit similar behaviour, in a geometric sense. The chapter offers an interesting methodological contribution, one that combines unsupervised learning with non-parametric statistics for discovering temporal associations (or dependence) in repeated, classified, time-series data. 
   After providing some background on barycentres, specifically Riemannian barycentres and cosine-barycentres, in Section 7.2, the author proceeds to describe the HURDAT2 dataset on hurricane trajectories, which inspires the methodology developed in the later sections. He eventually uses 179 North Atlantic hurricane trajectories from this dataset, which occurred in 37 years between 1950 and 2012 (years with two or fewer hurricanes are omitted). 
   The bulk of the methodology is presented in Section 7.4. First, the hurricane trajectories are clustered into k=20 clusters using a k-means algorithm. The k-means algorithm minimises the within-cluster sum of cosine distances, so that the cluster centroids are the barycentre centroids of the clusters. Once clustered, temporal association is assessed using the test statistic T=∑yTy, where 
Ty(x1,{\ldots},xhy)=∑i=2hyI[Xy,i=Xy,i−1],
Xy,i is the cluster of the ith hurricane (ordered according to time) in year y, and hy is the number of hurricanes in year y. 
   Second, the author makes a connection between Ty and the one-dimensional Potts model. He uses this relationship to approximate the mean and the variance of T (conditioned on the number of hurricanes per cluster per year) under the null hypothesis of no temporal association. An extension to allow for geometric temporal decay in association is also proposed. 
   Results, presented in Section 7.5, show that the normal approximation to the conditional distribution of T is adequate in practice. The author concedes that the rejection of the null hypothesis in the analysis of the North Atlantic hurricane trajectories is somewhat sensitive to the choice of hurricanes that were chosen for this study. In addition, the hypothesis test is implicitly dependent on the use of the k-means algorithm and the number of clusters k. Nonetheless, it is the overall framework, and not the specifics, that is appealing in this chapter. The work provides a methodological foundation for studying temporal associations in trajectory data that are classified according to some domain-specific criteria.

We demonstrate important scenarios where a model with a finite and deterministic number of streets, termed binomial line process, is more accurate. We characterize the statistical properties of the BLP and the corresponding binomial line Cox process and apply them to analyze the performance of a network whose access points are deployed along the streets of a city. Such a deployment scenario will be typical for 5G and future wireless networks. In order to obtain a fine-grained insight into the network performance, we derive the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference and noise ratio. Accordingly, we investigate the mean local delay in transmission and the density of successful transmission. These metrics, respectively, characterize the latency and coverage performance of the network and are key performance indicators of next-generation wireless systems.},

abstract = {The database of the HWind project sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for hurricanes between 1994 and 2013 is analysed. This is the first objective of the current research. Among these hurricanes, Hurricane Sandy was selected for a detailed study due to the number of files available and its social relevance, with this being the second objective of this study. Robust wind speed statistics showed a sharp increase in wind speed, around 6 m s−1 at the initial stage as Category 1, and a linear progression of its interquartile range, which increased at a rate of 0.54 m s−1 per day. Wind speed distributions were initially right-skewed. However, they evolved to nearly symmetrical or even left-skewed distributions. Robust kurtosis was similar to that of the Gaussian distribution. Due to the noticeable fraction of wind speed intermediate values, the Laplace distribution was used, its scale parameter increasing slightly during the hurricane's lifecycle. The key features of the current study were the surface and recirculation factor calculation. The surface area with a category equal to, or higher than, a tropical storm was calculated and assumed to be circular. Its radius increased linearly up to 600 km. Finally, parcel trajectories were spirals in the lower atmosphere but loops in the mid-troposphere due to wind translation and rotation. The recirculation factor varied, reaching values close to 0.9 and revealing atmospheric stratification.},

Similar results are given for uniform samples from the unit disk.},

abstract = {The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the size of smart grid are witnessing rapid expansion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This requires an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs). Such an allocation strategy should provide acceptable charging services at different deployment stages while meeting financial and technical constraints. As new CSs get allocated, distributed generation (DG) units need to be also dynamically allocated in both space and time to compensate for the increment in the loads due to the EV charging requests. Unfortunately, existing power grid models are not suitable to reflect such spatio-temporal evolution, and hence, new models need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal expanding power grid model based on stochastic geometry. Using this flexible model, we perform a dynamic joint allocation of EV CSs and DG units based on a constrained Markov decision process. The proposed dynamic allocation strategy accounts for charging coordination mechanism within each CS, which in turn allows for maximal usage of deployed chargers. We validate the proposed stochastic geometry-based power grid model against IEEE 123-bus test system. Then, we present a case study for a 5-year CSs deployment plan.},

Some quite general conditions are given, under which it is shown that the model is well defined and exhibits no percolation. The absence of percolation is attributable to the fact that, under our assumptions, there can be no descending chains in N. The proof of this fact forms a significant part of the paper.

At some time the use of brass weights became established to weight out the gold dust to pay for each transaction. Two separate accounts written around AD 1600 (see Menzel, 1968, p. 19) mention this practice. Examples of the brass weights are now to be found in many museum collections and recently there has been interest in deducing the weight system or systems used (Garrard, 1972).

The dead leaves model, introduced by the Mathematical Morphology school, consists in the superposition of random closed sets, and enables to model the occlusion phenomena. When combined with specific sizes distributions for objects, they are known to provide adequate models for natural images. However this framework yields a small scales cutoff and a limit random field is introduced by letting this cutoff tend to zero. We first give a rigorous definition of the dead leaves model, and compute the probability that n compacts are included in distinct visible parts, which characterizes the model. Then, we derive our limit model and some of its property, and study its regularity.},

abstract = {Stereology, or quantitative microscopy, is a basic research tool in science and technology. The emergence of design-based methods has greatly increased the power, flexibility, adaptability, and scope of stereology applications, establishing a closer connection between statistics and quantitative microscopy. Despite its scientific importance, modern stereology remains largely unknown to the statistical community, with valuable information either widely scattered or inaccessible to newcomers to the field. Now is the perfect time for a book that enables biostatisticians and statistical consultants to give beneficial advice to researchers in microscopy. Stereology for Statisticians sets out the principles of stereology from a statistical viewpoint, focusing on both basic theory and practical implications. This book discusses ways to effectively communicate statistical issues to clients, draws attention to common methodological errors, and provides references to essential literature. The first full text on design-based stereology, it opens with a review of classical and modern stereology, followed by a treatment of mathematical foundations such as geometry, probability, and statistical inference. The book then presents core techniques, including estimation of absolute geometrical quantities, relative quantities, and statistical inference for populations of discrete objects. The final chapters discuss implementing techniques in practical sampling designs, summarize understanding of the variance of stereological estimators, and describe open problems for further research.},

We prove that the sequence of connected components of G(n, p), considered as metric spaces using the graph distance rescaled by n -1/3, converges towards a sequence of continuous compact metric spaces. The result relies on a bijection between graphs and certain marked random walks, and the theory of continuum random trees. Our result gives access to the answers to a great many questions about distances in critical random graphs. In particular, we deduce that the diameter of G(n, p) rescaled by n -1/3 converges in distribution to an absolutely continuous random variable with finite mean. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

These are shown to be effective for models where an underlying random variable of interest is contaminated with noise. We also state explicit Poisson approximation bounds for sums of associated or negatively associated random variables. Applications are given to epidemic models, extremes, and random sampling. Finally, we also show how similar techniques may be used to relax the assumptions needed in a Poincar{\'{e}} inequality and in a normal approximation result.},

Such metrics appear naturally in discretisations of W2-gradient flow formulations for dissipative PDE. However, it has recently been shown that these metrics do not in general converge to W2, unless strong geometric constraints are imposed on the discrete mesh. In this paper we prove that, in a 1-dimensional periodic setting, discrete transport metrics converge to a limiting transport metric with a non-trivial effective mobility. This mobility depends sensitively on the geometry of the mesh and on the non-local mobility at the discrete level. Our result quantifies to what extent discrete transport can make use of microstructure in the mesh to reduce the cost of transport.},

of nineteenth-century mathematics, originated by Abel, Gauss,

account of the subject in the style of the original discoverers,
with references to and comments about more recent and modern
developments. It combines three of the fundamental themes of
mathematics: complex function theory, geometry, and arithmetic.
After an informal preparatory chapter, the book follows an
historical path, beginning with the work of Abel and Gauss on
elliptic integrals and elliptic functions. This is followed by
chapters on theta functions, modular groups and modular functions,
the quintic, the imaginary quadratic field, and on elliptic
curves. Requiring only a first acquaintance with complex function
theory, this book is an ideal introduction to the subject for
graduate students and researchers in mathematics and physics, with
many exercises with hints scattered throughout the text.},

As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classification, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classification.},

A crucial role in the theory of such models is played by the incidence function TZ(K)=P(Z∩K≠∅), defined for compact sets K. The paper deals mainly with models in which the grains are assigned independently to germs and are identically distributed. A condition is given in terms of the incidence function under which convergence in distribution of the grain and of the point process of germs implies convergence in distribution of the resulting germ-grain model. Ergodicity and mixing of a stationary germ-grain model are characterised in terms of its incidence function and it is shown that if a germ process is ergodic or mixing, then so is any germ-grain process resulting from it through the assignment of i.i.d. compact grains, provided its realisations are almost surely closed.

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach to predicting UK-wide daily traffic counts on all roads in England and Wales, irrespective of sensor data availability. A key finding of this research is that many roads in a network may have no local connection, but may still share some common law, and this fact can be exploited to improve simulation. In this paper we show that: (1) Traffic counts are a function of dependant spatial, temporal and neighbourhood variables, (2) Large open-source data, such as school location and public transport hubs can, with appropriate GIS and machine learning, assist the prediction of traffic counts, (3) Real-time simulation can be scaled-up to large networks with the aid of machine learning and, (4) Such techniques can be employed in real-world tools. Validation of the proposed approach demonstrates an 88.2{\%} prediction accuracy on traffic counts across the UK.},

abstract = {An important GL (n) invariant functional of centred (origin symmetric) convex bodies that has received particular attention is the volume product. For a centred convex body A ⊂ Rn it is defined by P (A) : = | A | ṡ | A* |, where | ṡ | denotes volume and A* is the polar body of A. If A is a centred zonoid, then it is known that P (A) ≥ P (Cn), where Cn is a centred affine cube, i.e. a Minkowski sum of n linearly independent centred segments. Equality holds in the class of centred zonoids if and only if A is a centred affine cube. Here we sharpen this uniqueness statement in terms of a stability result by showing in a quantitative form that the Banach-Mazur distance of a centred zonoid A from a centred affine cube is small if P (A) is close to P (Cn). This result is then applied to strengthen a uniqueness result in stochastic geometry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A family of kernels for statistical learning is introduced that exploits the geometric structure of statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classification, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classification.},

abstract = {Special functions, which include the trigonometric functions, have been used for centuries. Their role in the solution of differential equations was exploited by Newton and Leibniz, and the subject of special functions has been in continuous development ever since. In just the past thirty years several new special functions and applications have been discovered. This treatise presents an overview of the area of special functions, focusing primarily on the hypergeometric functions and the associated hypergeometric series. It includes both important historical results and recent developments and shows how these arise from several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Particular emphasis is placed on formulas that can be used in computation. The book begins with a thorough treatment of the gamma and beta functions that are essential to understanding hypergeometric functions. Later chapters discuss Bessel functions, orthogonal polynomials and transformations, the Selberg integral and its applications, spherical harmonics, q-series, partitions, and Bailey chains. This clear, authoritative work will be a lasting reference for students and researchers in number theory, algebra, combinatorics, differential equations, applied mathematics, mathematical computing, and mathematical physics.},

abstract = {We introduce the notions of tree-like path and tree-like equivalence between paths and prove that the latter is an equivalence relation for paths of finite length. We show that the equivalence classes form a group with some similarity to a free group, and that in each class there is one special tree reduced path. The set of these paths is the Reduced Path Group. It is a continuous analogue to the group of reduced words. The signature of the path is a power series whose coefficients are definite iterated integrals of the path. We identify the paths with trivial signature as the tree-like paths, and prove that two paths are in tree-like equivalence if and only if they have the same signature. In this way, we extend Chen's theorems on the uniqueness of the sequence of iterated integrals associated with a piecewise regular path to finite length paths and identify the appropriate extended meaning for reparameterisation in the general setting. It is suggestive to think of this result as a non-commutative analogue of the result that integrable functions on the circle are determined, up to Lebesgue null sets, by their Fourier coefficients. As a second theme we give quantitative versions of Chen's theorem in the case of lattice paths and paths with continuous derivative, and as a corollary derive results on the triviality of exponential products in the tensor algebra.},

First, following Benjamini, Jonasson, Schramm and Tykesson, we consider an invariant Poisson process of lines, and show that there is a critical value of the intensity below which a.s. the vacant set of the process percolates, and above which all its connected components are finite. Then, we consider an invariant Poisson process of roads (i.e, lines with speed limits), and show that there is a critical value of the parameter governing the speed limits of the roads below which a.s. one can drive to infinity in finite time using the road network generated by the process, and above which this is impossible.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},
